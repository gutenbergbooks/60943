<h2><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></h2>

<p>From the myths characteristic of savage tribes, from
their beliefs, their proverbs, their political and social
regulations, it is here sought to gain some general
estimate of their powers of intelligence and imagination,
their moral ideas, and their religion; subjects
naturally of much interest and inevitably of some
dispute. For the reason that in savagery as in civilisation
there are heights and depths, with more of
light here, more of darkness there, it is quite impossible
to bring the whole of savage life into focus at
once, so that every general conclusion can only be
taken as true within limits. The field to be studied
is also so large and diversified, that no two minds can
expect to derive from it the same impressions, nor to
attain to more than partial truth about it. But since
the savage can never hope to be heard in court himself,
it is only fair to start with certain considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
which he would be entitled to urge, and which deserve
to weigh in any judgment made regarding him.</p>

<p>Statements of very low powers of numeration
have been perhaps too hastily taken as indicative of
a low state of intelligence; for not only have similar
assertions concerning American and Tasmanian
tribes by the earliest voyagers proved on subsequent
investigation to be erroneous, but many savages have
substitutes for our arithmetic which serve them perfectly
well, the Loangese, for instance, expressing
numbers in narration not by words but by gestures;
and the Koossa Kaffirs—very few of whom are said to
be able to count above ten—possessing the peculiar
faculty of detecting almost at a glance any loss in a
herd of cattle which may amount to half a thousand.
In the same way the want of a written language is often
supplied by symbolism. Puzzle as it might a person
of education to read a letter, expressed by a bundle
containing a stone, a piece of charcoal, a rag, a
pepper-pod, and a grain of parched corn, this would
be the way of saying in Yoruba, that, though the
sender was as strong and firm as a stone, his prospects
were as dark as charcoal; that his clothes were
in rags; that he was so feverish with anxiety that
his skin burned like pepper, even enough to cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
corn to wither. The Niam-Niam, again, who declare
war by hanging on a tree an ear of maize, a fowl’s
feather, and an arrow, thereby giving contingent
enemies to understand that arrows will avenge any
injury done to a single fowl or a single ear of maize,
convey their meaning quite as clearly as the most
politely framed ultimata of any Foreign Office in
Europe.</p>

<p>Many of the beliefs attributed to savages are no
fair test of their general reasoning capabilities; for
there are degrees of credulity in savage as in civilised
life, and reason everywhere struggles to exist. When
Pelopidas, on the eve of the battle of Leuctra, received
commands in a dream to sacrifice to certain shades a
virgin with chestnut hair, there were not wanting
soldiers, even in that army of Bœotians, who had the
shrewdness to think and the courage to say, that it
was absurd to suppose any divine powers could delight
in the slaughter and sacrifice of human beings, and
that, if there were such, they deserved no reverence.
All stages of culture thus have their dissenters, their
wicked reasoners. Among the Ahts only the most
superstitious now burn the house of a dead man, with
all its contents, for fear of offending his ghost. The
Zulus, whose sole religion consists in ancestor-worship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
exhibited often in the most ridiculous ceremonies,
begin to doubt the power and even the existence of
their Amatongo, or dead ancestors, if, when they are
sick, their prayers and sacrifices fail to effect a cure.</p>

<p>The Tongan king, Finow, often stated to Mariner
his doubts about the existence of the gods, and
expressed the opinion, that men were fools for believing
all they were told by the priests; whilst his
saying, that the gods always favoured that side in war
on which there were the greatest chiefs and warriors,
recalls the opinion of a far more famous potentate than
Finow. The disrespect, indeed, that Finow showed
to the Tongan religion was such, that his subjects
explained violent thunderstorms as the dissensions of
the gods in Bolotu about his punishment. On the
other hand, savages are also subject to relapses of
superstition, such as with us are dignified by the name
of ‘movements;’ an American tribe who traced their
origin to a dog were so firmly impressed by a fanatic
with the sin of attaching their canine relatives to their
sledges, that they resolved to use dogs no more, but
women instead, for dragging their possessions.</p>

<p>Savage ideas of morality and of government seem
to agree fundamentally with those of more advanced
populations, the ideas of the latter differing, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
from the barbaric much as a finished photograph
differs from its earlier stage; that is to say, not as
essentially different, but as having become ‘fixed’ after
a process of development. The idea of the wrongfulness
of certain acts starts with the fear of their
consequences, that of murder, for instance, from the
fear of revenge; nor are such ideas ever separable
from the lowest levels of savage life. The sense of
the sanctity of property begins with what an individual
can make or catch for himself apart from tribal
claims; nor is any state of tribal communism so strong
as to recognise no private rights in the people or
things a man takes in war, the game he kills, or the
weapons he fashions. Respect for the aged is one of
the best traits of savage life, for the tribes of whom it
is asserted seem to outnumber those of whom it is
denied. In Equatorial Africa young men never
appear before old ones without curtseying nor pass
them by without stooping; should they sit in their
presence, it is ‘at a humble distance.’ Nor are cases
of the abandonment of the aged and infirm conclusive
proof of a deficiency of natural affection; one tribe
who were accused of so acting are also known to have
carried about with them for years a palsied man with
great tenderness and attention. Truthfulness, again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
is recognised as a virtue outside the pale of the higher
religions, for Mungo Park found it one of the first
lessons taught by Mandingo women to their children,
and he mentions the case of one mother, whose only
consolation on the murder of her son ‘was the reflection
that the poor boy in the course of his life had
never told an untruth.’</p>

<p>Strange contradictions abound in savage life, extremes
of barbarity sometimes co-existing with habits
of some refinement. The Ahts, who occasionally
sacrifice one of their number to the gods, and till
lately deserted their sick and aged, without the excuse
of scarcity of food, keep small mats of bark strips for
strangers to wipe their feet with, and after meals
offer them water and cedar-bark for washing their
hands and mouths. They have also a strict etiquette
regulating their reception of guests; they observe
public ceremonies with extreme formality; their men
of rank vie with one another in politeness. The Niam-Niam
are generally cannibals, but when several of
them drink together ‘they may each be observed
to wipe the rim of the drinking-vessel before passing
it on.’ The Bachapins, among whom it is said that a
murderer incurs no disgrace, yet measure a man’s
merit by his industry, and despise a man who does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
not work, that is, hunt, for his living. The Aztecs, with
their constant and frightful human sacrifices, were so
afraid of incurring divine wrath for the blood they
spilled in the chase, that they would always preface a
hunt by burning incense to their idols, and conclude
it by smearing the faces of their divinities with
the blood of their game. To turn back from the
procession which accompanied the sacrifice of young
children to the gods of rain and water rendered a man
infamous and incapable of public office; yet death was
the penalty for drunkenness in either sex, and ‘it was
considered degrading for a person of quality to touch
wine at all, even in seasons of festival.’ Similar
inconsistencies are common in social regulations,
especially in those relating to marriage, stringent
laws of prohibited degrees and the strictest etiquette
often affording no further evidence of purity of
manners. The most barbarous marriage ceremonies
are frequently attended with absurd forms of prudery,
which it is perhaps impossible to trace to their origin.
The instance of the Aleutian islanders, who with the
grossest vices connect such notions of propriety as
that either a husband or a wife would blush to address
the other in the presence of a stranger, is one among
many similar illustrations of a side of savage life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
which but for parallels in our own social usages might
present itself as an inexplicable anomaly.</p>

<p>Better experience has in so many cases dissipated
original assertions of an absolute want of religious
ideas among savages, that the strongest doubts must
be felt of all similar negative propositions. Theology
in one of three grades seems rather to be the
universal property of mankind, appearing either
harmless, as at the beginning or end of its historical
career, or in its second and middle stage as identical
with all that is abominable and cruel. The classification
of mankind on such a basis of division, though it
could never aspire to scientific exactness, would afford
at least a standard of practical discrimination, by
which the relations between Christian and non-Christian
communities might to some extent be adjusted;
for, by considering any people under one of these three
aspects, it would be possible to form some estimate
of their aptitude for, or need of, our theology, and of
the advisability of our seeking to force it upon them.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Should the principle ever meet with the acceptance
it deserves, that missions, like charities, ought to be
discriminate, it is not difficult to perceive the direction
in which such a truth will be likely some day to
receive practical recognition.</p>

<p>For wherever native theology takes the form of
cannibalism, sutteeism, human sacrifices, or other
rites directly destructive of earthly happiness, there
the teaching of missionaries affords the only hope of
a speedy reform, the only acquaintance possible for
savage tribes with a culture higher than their own,
save that which is likely to come to them through
the medium of the brandy-bottle or the bayonet. But
to send missions to countries like Russia or China,
where there exist established systems of religion
undefiled by cruelty, violates the first principle of
the faith so conveyed, disturbing the peace of families
and nations with the curse of religious animosity.
When the Jesuits entreated the Chinese Emperor,
Young-tching, to reconsider his resolution to proscribe
Christianity, there was some reason in the imperial
answer: ‘What should you say if I sent a troop of
lamas and bonzes to your country, to preach their
law there?’ The Taeping rebellion, or civil war,
which devastated China for about fifteen years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
desolating hundreds of miles of fair towns and fertile
fields, and fought out among massacres, sieges, and
famines, of quite indescribable cruelty and horror,
owed its impulse distinctly to the working of Christian
tracts among the more ignorant classes, followed by
a fanatical endeavour to substitute a travesty of
Christianity for the older religions; yet the seeds of all
this misery are still sown in China, in the name and
by the ministers of a religion of Peace, a religion that
has for its first and final rule of life the duty of so
dealing with others as we should wish them to deal
with ourselves.</p>

<p>Cases of the third class, where the state of religious
belief is so rudimentary as to be innocuous, are unhappily
few; but where such belief has not advanced to
the detriment of the general welfare, it would seem the
kindest policy not to inspire men, whose lives are spent
in the constant perils of the woods or waves, with fears
of more malignant spirits than those their own fancy
has created for them, nor to teach them the doctrine
that, hard and black as this world often proves to them,
there is a yet harder and blacker one beyond. There
is also some charm in that variety of belief and
custom against which we wage unremitting war; and
only a tasteless fanaticism can think with pure joy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the time, when sectarian chapels shall stand on every
island of the seas, and Tartarus be taught wherever
the sun shines. Rites and beliefs lose the interest
which cling to them in their native home as soon as it
is sought to transplant them elsewhere, just as flowers
lose their fragrance and beauty when once they have
been separated from the plant on which they grew.
For this reason Puritanism has but little charm out of
England; and though it should please our love of
uniformity to read (as we may) of a Tahitian chief
carrying his Sabbatarian scruples so far as to ask
whether, if he saw ripe plantains by his garden-path
on Sunday, he might pick and eat them; or of another
abstaining from turning a pig out of his garden on
Sunday, preferring to let his sugar-canes be devoured;
such facts are yet no proof that we make Christians
of savages; they only prove that, with some trouble,
we may make them imbeciles.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, indeed, to pay too high a
tribute to the unselfish efforts of missionaries, now
and in past times, directly for the benefit of mankind
and indirectly for that of science; yet the question,
besides its speculative interest, derives some justification
from the general results of missions over the
world, and from the melancholy disproportion between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
their actual and their merited successes: Whether the
welfare and improvement of savage tribes would not
be best left to themselves and to time? That they
are not incapable of independent improvement there
is abundant evidence to show. Sometimes it arises in a
tribe from imitation of some neighbouring tribe, more
powerful but less barbarous than itself; sometimes
from the initiative of some reforming chief of its own.
Thus the Comanche Indians of Texas, among whom
‘Christianity had never been introduced,’ abolished,
in consequence of their intercourse with tribes less
savage than themselves, the inhuman custom of killing
a favourite wife at her husband’s funeral. Mariner
was himself a witness of the abolition on the Tongan
Islands of the custom of strangling the wife of the
great Tooitonga chief at his death. It is said, again,
to be an indisputable fact, that the Monbuttoos of
Africa, whose ‘cannibalism is the most pronounced
of all the known nations of Africa,’ have, ‘without
any influence from the Mahometan or Christian world,
attained to no contemptible degree of external culture.’
Finow, the Tongan king, was a genuine reformer;
and there have even been kings of Dahome
who have wished the abolition of human sacrifices.
Bianswah, the great Chippewya chief, put a stop, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
a treaty of peace with the Sioux, to the horrible practice
of burning prisoners alive; and, though the peace
between the tribes was often broken, their compact
in this respect was never violated. In other instances
the modification of older usages points to the operation
of reformative tendencies. Thus the Nootka
Indians, who used to conclude their hunting festivals
with a human sacrifice, subsequently changed the
custom into the more lenient one of sticking a boy
with knives in various parts of his body. The Zulus
abolished the custom of killing slaves with a chief, to
prepare food and other things for him in the next
world; so that now it is only a tradition with them
that formerly when a chief died he did not die alone:
‘when the fire was kindled the chief was put in, and
then his servants were chosen and put in after the
chief; the great men followed—they were taken one
by one.’</p>

<p>It is moreover certain that in some instances
savages have arrived spontaneously at no contemptible
notions of morality, and that they have often lost
their native virtues by their very contact with a higher
form of faith. The African Bakwains declared that
nothing described by the missionaries as sin had ever
appeared to them otherwise, except polygamy; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
the Tongan chiefs (if Mariner may be trusted), when
asked what motives they had, beyond their fear of
misfortunes in this life, for virtuous conduct, replied,
‘<i>as if they wondered such a question should be asked</i>:’
‘The agreeable and happy feelings which a man experiences
within himself when he does any good
action and conducts himself nobly and generously, as
a man ought to do.’ The natural virtues attributed
to the same people include honour, justice, patriotism,
friendship, meekness, modesty, conjugal fidelity,
parental and filial love, patience in suffering, forbearance
of temper, respect for rank and for age. The
Khonds of India, much more savage than the Tongans
(their chief virtues consisting in killing an enemy,
dying as a warrior, or living as a priest), yet account
as sinful acts the refusal of hospitality, the breach of
an oath or promise, a lie, or the violation of a pledge
of friendship. The virtues the Maoris now possess
they are said to have possessed before we came among
them, namely honesty, self-respect, truthfulness; and
the belief that these virtues are even ‘fading under
their assumed Christianity’ recalls the tradition of
certain American tribes, that their lives and manners
were originally less barbarous, the Odjibwas, for instance,
actually tracing the increase of murders, thefts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
falsehood, and disobedience to parents, to the advent
of the Christian whites.</p>

<p>It is also remarkable that in several instances
savages have of themselves hit upon those very helps to
the maintenance of virtue which all Christian Churches
have found so efficacious. For we find existing
among them as religious and moral observances not
only Fasting and Confession, but occasionally even
Sermons. In the Tongan Islands <i>fonos</i>, or public
assemblies, were held, at which the king would address
his subjects, not only on agriculture but on morals
and politics; and the lower chiefs had <i>fonos</i> also for
the similar benefit of their feudal subordinates. In
America, also, some tribes observed feasts at which
the young were addressed on their moral duties, being
admonished to be attentive and respectful to the old,
to obey their parents, never to scoff at the decrepit or
deformed, to be charitable and hospitable. Not only
were such precepts dwelt on at great length, but enforced
by the examples of good and bad individuals,
just as they might be in London or Rome. Such
considerations, indeed, prove nothing against the additional
good that missionaries may do; but they add
some force to the thought that had a tithe of the
energy, the devotion, the suffering, the money, that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
been lavished on coaxing savages to be baptized, been
spent on promoting international peace in Europe,
wars might by this time be as extinct, belong as
purely to a past state of things, as judicial combats,
the thumbscrew, or the knout.</p>

<p>The vexed question, whether savage life represents
a primitive or a decadent condition, whether it represents
what man at first everywhere was, or only
what he may become, has throughout the following
chapters been avoided, that controversy being regarded
as ‘laid’ by the exhaustive researches of
Mr. Tylor and other writers. But whilst the state
of the lowest modern savages is taken as the nearest
approximation we have of the primitive state from
which mankind has risen, it is not pretended that
the state of any particular tribe may not be one to
which it has fallen. As the low position of many
Bushmen tribes is quite explicable by their long
border-warfare with the Dutch, and the consequent
cruelties they were exposed to, or as the state of
many Brazilian savages may be traced to similar
contact with the Portuguese, so any case of extreme
savagery may be the result of causes, whose operation
has no historical or written proof to attest them.
The gigantic stone images on Easter Island, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
great earthworks in America, are among the proofs,
that but for such material traces of its existence it
is possible for a whole civilisation to vanish, and to
leave only the veriest savages on the soil where it
flourished.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As we know that Europe was once as
purely savage as parts of Africa are still, and can
conceive the cycle of events restoring it to barbarism, so
in the depths of time it may have happened in places
where no suspicion of such a history is possible. As
the surface of the earth seems subjected to processes
of elevation and subsidence, land and sea constantly
alternating their dominion, so it may be with civilisation,
destined to no permanent home on the earth,
but subsiding here to reappear there, and varying
its level as it varies its latitude.</p>

<p>As the practical infinity of past time makes it
impossible to calculate the influence exercised in
different parts of the world by migrations, by conquests,
or by commerce, except within a very limited
period, so it precludes any definite belief in ethnological
divisions, and relegates the question of the
unity of the human race, like that of its origin, to the
limbo of profitless discussion. No characteristic has
yet been found by which mankind can be classified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
distinctly into races; and with all the differences of
colour, hair, skull, or language, which now suffice
for purposes of nomenclature, it remains true that
there is nothing to choose between the hypothesis
that we constitute only one species and the hypothesis
that we constitute several. The world is so old as
to admit of divergences from a single original type
quite as wide as any that exist; whilst, on the other
hand, similarity of customs (such, for instance, as that
Tartars in Asia, Sioux Indians in America, and
Kamschadals should all regard it as a sin to touch
a fire with a knife), fail us as a proof of a unity of
origin, in the face of our ignorance of prehistoric
antiquity.</p>

<p>That the works which have treated before, and
better, of the subjects included in the following
chapters should have exercised no deterrent effect in
treating of them again, must find its excuse in the
general interest which those works have produced
for the studies in question, and of which the present
work is but a sign and consequence. The reader
has only himself to blame, if, having read the works
on the same or similar subjects by Mr. Tylor, Mr.
Spencer, and Sir John Lubbock, or those in German
by Peschel, Wuttke, or Waitz, he troubles himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
with yet another book which seeks rather to illustrate
than to exhaust the many interesting problems connected
with savage life; but the present writer, whilst
under the deepest obligations to the labours of his
predecessors—without which his own would have
been impossible—has not studied simply to recapitulate
their conclusions, but has sought rather to arrive
at such results as the evidence forced upon him, independently
as far as possible of existing theories or of
the authority upon which they rest. Should he have
succeeded in making anyone think better than before,
with more interest and sympathy, of those outcasts
of the world whom we designate as savage, something
at least will have been done to claim for them a kindlier
treatment and respect than in popular estimation
they either deserve or obtain.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>SOME SAVAGE MYTHS AND BELIEFS.</i></span></h2>

<p>The question of the universality of religion, of its
presence in some form or another in every part of the
world, seems to be one of those which lie beyond the
bounds of a dogmatic answer. For the accounts of
missionaries and travellers, which furnish the only
data for its solution, have been so largely vitiated, if
not by a consciousness of the interests supposed to
be at stake, at least by so strong an intolerance for
the tenets of native savage religions, that it seems
impossible to make sufficient allowance either for the
bias of individual writers or for the extent to which
they may have misunderstood, or been purposely
misled by, their informants.</p>

<p>Although, however, on the subject of native
religions we can never hope for more than approximate
truth, the reports of missionaries and others,
written at different periods of time about the same
place or contemporaneously about widely remote
places, as they must be free from all possible suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of collusion, so they supply a kind of measure
of probability by which the credibility of any given
belief may be tested. Thus an idea, too inconceivable
to be credited, if only reported of one tribe of the
human race, may be safely accepted as seriously held,
if reported of several tribes in different parts of the
world. An Englishman, for instance, however much
winds and storms may mentally vex him, would
scarcely think of testifying his repugnance to them
by the physical remonstrance of his fists and lungs,
nor would he easily believe that any people of the
earth should seriously treat the wind in this way as a
material agent. If he were told that the Namaquas
shot poisoned arrows at storms to drive them away,
he would show no unreasonable scepticism in disbelieving
the fact; but if he learnt on independent
authority that the Payaguan Indians of North
America rush with firebrands and clenched fists
against the wind that threatens to blow down their
huts; that in Russia the Esthonians throw stones
and knives against a whirlwind of dust, pursuing it
with cries; that the Kalmucks fire their guns to drive
the storm-demons away; that Zulu rain-doctors or
heaven-herds whistle to lightning to leave the skies
just as they whistle to cattle to leave their pens;
and that also in the Aleutian Islands a whole village
will unite to shriek and strike against the raging wind,
he would have to acknowledge that the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
about the Namaquas contained in itself nothing
intrinsically improbable. And besides this test of
genuine savage thought, a test which obviously
admits of almost infinite application, there is another
one no less serviceable in ethnological criticism,
namely, where the reality of a belief is supported by
customs, widely spread and otherwise unintelligible.
No better illustration can be given of this than the
belief, which, asserted by itself, would be universally
disbelieved, in a second life not only for men but for
material things; but which, supported as it is by the
practice, common alike in the old world and the new,
of burying objects with their owner to live again with
him in another state, is certified beyond all possibility
of doubt. If to us there seems a no more self-evident
truth than that a man can take nothing with him out
of the world, a vast mass of evidence proves, that the
discovery of this truth is one of comparatively modern
date and of still quite partial distribution over the
globe.</p>

<p>So much, then, being premised as to the nature of
the evidence on which our knowledge of the lower
races depends, and as to the limits within which such
evidence may be received and its veracity tested, let
us proceed to examine some of the higher beliefs of
savages, which, as they bear some analogy to the
beliefs on similar subjects of more advanced societies,
are in a sense religious, and, so far at least as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
collected information justifies us in judging, seem of
indigenous and independent growth.</p>

<p>Few results of ethnology are more interesting
than the wide-spread belief among savages, arrived at
purely by their own reasoning faculties, in a creator
of things. The recorded instances of such a belief
are, indeed, so numerous as to make it doubtful
whether instances to the contrary may not have been
based on too scant information. The difficulty of
obtaining sound evidence on such subjects is well
illustrated by the experience of Dobritzhoffer, the
Jesuit missionary, who spent seven years among the
Abipones of South America. For when he asked
them whether the wonderful course of the stars and
heavenly bodies had never raised in their minds the
thought of an invisible being who had made and who
guided them, he got for answer that of what happened
in heaven, or of the maker or ruler of the stars, the
ancestors of the Abipones had never cared to think,
finding ample occupation for their thoughts in the providing
of grass and water for their horses. Yet the
Abipones really believed that they had been created
by an Indian like themselves, whose name they
mentioned with great reverence and whom they
spoke of as their ‘grandfather,’ because he had lived
so long ago. He was still, they fancied, to be seen in
the Pleiades; and when that constellation disappeared
for some months from the sky they would bewail the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
illness of their grandfather, and congratulate him on
his recovery when he returned in May. Still, the
creator of savage reasoning is not necessarily a
creator of all things, but only of some, like Caliban’s
Setebos, who made the moon and the sun, and the
isle and all things on it—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">But not the stars; the stars came otherwise.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So that it is possible the creator of the Abipones was
merely their deified First Ancestor. For on nothing
is savage thought more confused than on the connection
between the first man who lived on the world
and the actual Creator of the world, as if in the
logical need of a first cause they had been unable to
divest it of human personality, or as if the natural
idea of a first man had led to the idea of his having
created the world. Thus Greenlanders are divided
as to whether Kaliak was really the creator of all
things or only the first man who sprang from the
earth. The Minnetarrees of North America believed
that at first everything was water and there was no
earth at all, till the First Man, the never-dying one,
the Lord of Life, sent down the great red-eyed bird
to bring up the earth. The Mingo tribes also ‘revere
and make offerings to the First Man, he who was
saved at the great deluge, as a powerful deity under
the Master of Life, or <i>even as identified with him</i>;’
whilst among the Dog-ribs the First Man, Chapewee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was also creator of the sun and moon. The Zulus of
Africa likewise merge the ideas of the First Man and
the Creator, the great Unkulunkulu; as also do the
Caribs, who believe that Louquo, the uncreate first
Carib, descended from heaven to make the earth and
also to become the father of men.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So again in the
Aht belief Quawteaht is not only ‘the first Indian who
ever lived,’ their forefather, but the maker of most
things visible, of the earth and all animals, yet not of
the sun and moon.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It seems, therefore, not improbable
that savage speculation, being more naturally
impelled to assume a cause for men than a cause for
other things, postulated a First Man as primeval
ancestor, and then applying an hypothesis, which
served so well to account for their own existence, to
account for that of the world in general, made the
Father of Men the creator of all things; in other
words, that the idea of a First Man preceded and
prepared the way for the idea of a first cause.</p>

<p>However this may be, and admitting the possible
existence of tribes absolutely devoid of any idea of
creation at all, the following savage fancies about it
are not without their interest as typical examples of
primitive cosmogony.</p>

<p>In one of the Dog-rib Indian sagas an important
part in the creation is played by a great bird, as among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
several other tribes who loved to trace their origin
to a bird, as some would trace theirs to a toad or a
rattlesnake. Originally, the saga runs, the world was
nothing but a wide, waste sea, without any living
thing upon it save a gigantic bird, who with the
glance of its fiery eyes produced the lightning, and
with the flapping of its wings the thunder. This bird,
by diving into the sea, caused the earth to appear
above it, and proceeded to call all animals to its
surface (except, indeed, the Chippewya Indians, who
were descended from a dog). When its work was
complete it made a great arrow, which it bade the
Indians keep with great care; and when this was
lost, owing to the stupidity of the Chippewyas, it was
so angry that it left the earth, never afterwards to revisit
it; and men now live no longer, as they did in
those days, till their throats are worn through with
eating and their feet with walking the earth.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Many thousands of miles separate the Tongan
Islands from North America, yet there too we find
the idea of the earth having come from the waters.
In the beginning nothing was to be seen above the
waste of waters but the Island of Bolotu, which is as
everlasting as the gods who dwell there or as the
stars and the sea. One day the god Tangaloa went
to fish in the sea, when, feeling something heavy at
the end of his line, he drew it in, and there perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the tops of rocks, which continued to increase in size
and number till they formed a large continent, and
his line broke, and only the Tongan Islands remained
above the surface. These Tangaloa, with the help
of the other gods, filled with trees and herbs and
animals from Bolotu, only of a smaller size and not
immortal. Then he bade his two sons take their
wives and go to dwell in Tonga, dividing the land
and dwelling apart. The younger brother was
steady and industrious, and made many discoveries;
but the elder was idle and slept away his time, and
envied the works of his brother, till at last his envy
grew so strong that one day he murdered him. Then
came Tangaloa in wrath from Bolotu, to ask him
why he had slain his brother, and he bade him bring
his brother’s family to him. They were told to take
their boats and sail eastward till they came to a
great land to dwell in. ‘Your skin’ (to this effect
ran Tangaloa’s blessing) ‘shall be white as your
souls, for your souls are pure; you shall be wise,
make axes, have all other riches, and great boats.
I myself will command the wind to blow from your
land to Tonga, but the people of Tonga will not be
able with their bad boats to reach you.’ To the
others he said: ‘You shall be black, because your
souls are black, and you shall remain poor. You
shall not be able to prepare useful things, nor to go
to the land of your brothers. But your brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
shall come to Tonga and trade with you as they
please.’<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This Tongan creation-myth is especially striking,
not only from its resemblance to the well-known
stories of Cain and Abel or of Romulus and Remus,
but from the wonderful extension of a similar story
over the world. It has been found among the Esquimaux,
among the Hervey Islanders, among the
Hindoos, among the Iroquois of America. Its origin
perhaps lies in early and rude attempts to account
for the more obvious dualisms in nature, as those, for
instance, between the sun and the moon, or between
warm and cold winds. In the Iroquois version
the elder brother who killed the younger is said to
have been identical with the sun, though his mother,
not the brother he killed, was the moon.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A curious
Indian drawing has been preserved in which the god
of the north wind, or of cold weather, contends with
the god of the south, or of warmth. The former is
figured in a snowstorm, the latter in rain; wolves
fight on the side of the one, the crow and plover on
that of the other. The conflict is terrible; the
southern god is worsted, cold weather prevails, and
the earth is frozen up. But in spring he sends forth
his crow and plover, who defeat the wolves, and the
northern god is drowned in a flood of spray which
arises from the melting of the snow and ice. And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
this contention for cold and warm weather it is believed
they will battle as long as the world shall endure.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Kamchadal belief is instructive, as showing
that by the creation of the world the savage only means
that small portion of it which he knows, and that, so far
from it being any proof of his intelligence to suppose a
cause for the hills or island which limit his energies,
it is rather his want of logical thought which impels
him to the belief. For seeing, as he does, a spirit in
everything, whether it be moving animal, or rushing
wind, or standing stone, and accounting, as he does,
for everything by a spirit which is at once its cause
and controlling principle, it is only natural that he
should draw from his unlimited spirit-world one who
made and governs all things. Thus the Kamchadals
believe that after their supreme deity, of whom
they predicate nothing but existence, the greatest
god is Kutka. Kutka created the heavens and
the earth, making both eternal, like the men and
creatures he placed on the earth. But the Kamchadals
openly avow that they think themselves
much cleverer than Kutka, who in their eyes is so
stupid as to be quite undeserving of prayers or gratitude.
Had he been cleverer, they say, he would
have made the world much better, without so many
mountains and inaccessible cliffs, without streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of such rapidity, or such tempests of wind and rain.
In winter, if they are climbing a mountain, or in
summer, if their canoes come to rapids, they will
vent loud curses on Kutka for having made the
streams too strong for their canoes, or the mountains
so wearisome for their feet.</p>

<p>The Tamanaks of the Orinoco manifested a not
much higher conception of a creator than the Kamchadals.
For they ascribed the creation of the world
to Amalivacca, who in the course of his work discussed
long with his brother about the Orinoco, having the
kind wish so to make it that ships might as easily
go up its stream as down, but being compelled to
abandon a task which so far transcended his powers.
The Tamanaks recently showed a cave where Amalivacca
dwelt when he lived among them, before
he took a boat and sailed to the other side of the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Not only, however, is the idea of a creation of
things quite common among untutored savages, but
there is often a belief closely connected therewith
that in the beginning death and sickness were unknown
in the world, but came into it in consequence
of some fault committed by its hitherto immortal occupants.
Such a belief, reported as it is from places
so widely sundered as Ceylon, North America, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the Tongan Islands, seems effectually to discountenance
the suspicion which might otherwise attach to
it of collusion or mistake on the part of our informants.
It is the fancy of the Cingalese cosmogony
that, in the fifth period of creative energy, the immortal
beings who then inhabited the earth ate of
certain plants, and thereby involved themselves in
darkness and mortality. ‘It was then that they were
formed male and female, and lost the power of returning
to the heavenly mansions.’ Liable as they
had theretofore been to mental passions, such as envy,
covetousness, and ambition, they were thenceforward
subjected to corporeal passions as well, and the race
now inhabiting the earth became subject to all the evils
that afflict them.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> According to the saga of the Dog-rib
Indians the first man who lived upon the earth, when
food and other good things abounded, was Chapewee,
who afterwards, giving his children two kinds of food,
black and white, forbade them to eat of the former.
When he went away for a long journey to bring the
sun into the world, his children were obedient and
ate only of the white fruit, but ate it all. But when
he went away a second time to bring the moon into
the world, in their hunger his children forgot his
prohibition and ate of the black fruit. So when
Chapewee returned he was very wroth, and declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that thenceforth the earth should only produce bad
fruit and that men should be subject to sickness and
death. Afterwards, indeed, when his family lamented
that men should have been made mortal for eating
the black fruit, Chapewee granted that those who
dreamt certain dreams should have the power of
curing sickness and so of prolonging human life;
but that was the extent to which Chapewee relented.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The Caribs, Waraues, and Arawaks are said to believe
in two distinct creators of men and women;
the creator of the former being superior and doing
neither good nor harm. After he had created men
he came on the earth to see what they were doing;
but finding them so bad that they even attempted
his own life, he took from them their immortality
and gave it to skin-casting creatures instead. The
Aleutian Islanders believe that the god who made
their islands completed his work by making men to
inhabit them; but these men were immortal beings,
for when age came over them they had but to climb
a lofty mountain and plunge from thence into a lake,
in order to come forth young again and vigorous. Then
it happened that a mortal woman, who had the misfortune
to draw upon herself celestial love, remonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
one day with her lover for having, in his
creation of the Aleutian Islands, made so many
mountains and forgotten to supply the land with
forests. This imprudent criticism caused her brother
to be slain by the angry god, and all men after
him to be subject to death. A similar idea is contained
in one of the Tongan traditions of creation;
for when the islands were made, but before they were
inhabited by reasonable beings, some two hundred
of the lower gods, male and female alike, took a
great boat to go to see the new land fished up by
Tangaloa. So delighted were they with it that they
immediately broke up their big boat, intending to
make some smaller ones out of it. But after a few
days some of them died; and one of them, inspired
by God, told them that since they had come to Tonga,
and breathed its air and eaten its fruits, they should
be mortal and fill the world with mortals. Then
were they sorry that they had broken their big boat,
and they set to work to make another, and went to
sea, hoping again to reach Bolotu, the heaven they
had left; but being unable to find it, they returned
regretfully to Tonga.</p>

<p>Thus it would seem that wherever men have
so far advanced in power of thought as to realise
the conception of antiquity, the troubles of their
actual lot have always tempted them to idealise the
past, and the glories of the age of gold have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
sung by the poets of no particular land nor literature.
The Shawnee Indians believed there was a time
when they could walk on the ocean or restore life
to the dead, till they lost these privileges when the
nation by its carelessness became divided into two.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The Ashantees trace all their calamities to the folly
of their ancestors, for when the first created black
men were given their choice between a large box
and a piece of sealed-up paper they elected to take
the box, but found therein only some gold, iron, and
other metals, whilst the white men on opening the
paper found all that was needful to make them wise,
and have ever since treated the blacks as their slaves.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It is remarkable that a similar fancy is ascribed to the
Navajoes of New Mexico. For their ancestors, after
creating the sun and moon, made two water-jars, both
covered at the top, but one gorgeously painted, containing
only rubbish, the other of plain earthenware,
unpainted, but containing flocks and herds and other
valuables. The Navajoes, allowed to choose before
the Pueblos, took the beautiful but worthless jar;
whereupon the old men said: ‘Thus it will always
be with the two nations. You, Navajoes, will be a
poor and wandering race; destitute of the comforts
of life and ever greedy for things on account of their
outward show rather than their intrinsic value; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Pueblos will enjoy an abundance of the good
things of life, will occupy houses, and have plenty of
flocks and herds.’<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> According to the legend in the
Zend-Avesta, when Ormuzd created Meschia and
Meschiana, the first man and woman, he appointed
heaven as their dwelling, under the sole condition of
humility and obedience to the law of pure thought,
pure speech, and pure action. For some time they
were a blessing to one another and lived happily,
saying that it was from Ormuzd that all things came—the
water and earth, trees and animals, sun, moon,
and stars, and all good roots and fruits on the earth.
But at last Ahriman became master over their
thoughts, and they ascribed the creation of all things
to him. So they lost their happiness and their virtue,
and their souls were condemned to remain in Duzakh
until the resurrection of their bodies, when Sosiosch
should restore life to the dead.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Among the myths, however, most widely spread
over the world and common to races in all stages
of culture, from the most barbarous to the most
civilized, a prominent place is due to the legend of an
all-destructive deluge, a legend which, arising as it
probably did in many different places from exaggerated
memories of purely local floods, must, in spite
of its seeming universality, remain a merely local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
myth, entirely destitute of all bearing on the question
of the unity of the human race, or of any connection
with the story told in Genesis. A local flood
like that which on the occasion of an earthquake in
1819 was caused by the sea flowing in at the eastern
mouth of the Indus and converting in the space of a
few hours a district of 2,000 square miles into a vast
lagoon, would naturally be an event which would remain
for ever in the oral traditions of the district and
tend to become magnified when the event itself was
forgotten. In Australia, which is subject at certain
epochs and in certain localities to great inundations,
and which bears evidence of former floods in what
are now waterless deserts, flood stories are said to
be ‘exceedingly common’ among all the tribes, one
tribe having a tradition that when they returned to
their old hunting-grounds on the banks of a river,
after a great flood, they found the sea flowing where
had stood the other bank, nor any trace left of its
former inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Or, again, it is possible that alterations in the
level of the sea and land or the subsidence of a large
continent, such as that of which on geological as well
as ethnological grounds it has been supposed that the
Polynesian islands are the remains, may have originated
the tradition. Thus, the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg
imagined the submersion of a large country in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Atlantic to account for the deluge-myths of the
Central American nations.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Dr. Brinton, indeed, suggests,
that not physics, but metaphysics is the exciting
cause of beliefs in periodical convulsions of the globe,
maintaining that ‘by nothing short of a miracle’
could savages preserve the remembrance of even the
most terrible catastrophe beyond a few generations.
But it is at least as likely that such remembrance
should be possible as that savages, starting, as he
supposes, with an idea of creation as a reconstruction
of existing elements, should have added thereto the
myth of a universal catastrophe, ‘to avoid the dilemma
of a creation from nothing on the one hand and the
eternity of matter on the other.’<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Perhaps, however,
all such legends are best regarded as pure nature-myths,
to which we may possibly find the key in the
belief of the Esquimaux, that the souls of the dead are
encamped round a large lake in the sky, which when it
overflows causes rain upon earth and would cause a
universal deluge if at any time its floodgates were
burst. The belief in a contingency is never far from
the assertion of its actuality, nor are the steps of thought
always visible which separate the possible from the real.</p>

<p>Although many of the deluge-myths of the world
have doubtless owed their origin to the zeal with
which they have been sought for in the cause of orthodox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
theories, it is improbable that all of them have
been produced in this way. Dr. Brinton, who has
examined the evidence with care, asserts that there
are twenty-eight American nations among whom a
distinct and well-authenticated myth of the deluge
was found.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It would be tedious to allude to more than a few
illustrations of the belief as it exists in the world, or
to try to distinguish the elements in them of purely
native growth from the influences of Christian teaching.
The Kamchadals believe that the earth was
once flooded and many persons drowned, though they
tried to save themselves in boats, those only succeeding
who made great rafts of trees and let down stones
for anchors, to prevent themselves from drifting out
to sea; when the waters subsided their rafts rested on
the mountain-tops. The Esquimaux appealed to the
bones of whales found on their mountains in support
of their assertion that the world had once been
tilted over and all men drowned but one. The
Mandan Indians, according to Catlin, celebrated every
year in pantomime the subsidence of the great waters.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It is noticeable that in most savage legends of a
flood (and it may, perhaps, be taken as some test of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
their authenticity) there is an entire absence of the
idea, so familiar to ourselves, of the flood having resulted
from any fault committed by the then inhabitants
of the earth. At most such an idea appears
in germ, as in the tradition of the Society Islanders,
that a fisherman, catching his hook in the hair of the
great sea-god as he lay asleep in his coral grove, so
angered that divinity that he caused the waters to
arise till they flooded the very tops of the mountains
and drowned the inhabitants, the fisherman and his
family alone being suffered to escape, and thereby
serving to attest the genuineness of the tradition.
So in Fiji the deluge was caused by two grandsons
of a god killing his favourite bird, and instead of
being apologetic acting with insolence and fortifying
the town they lived in for the purpose of defying
their grandfather. The connection of the catastrophe
with human wickedness belongs apparently to a more
advanced state of thought, of which the recently deciphered
Chaldæan version may be taken as a sample.
In it Hasisadra, the sage, who with his wife escaped
the general destruction, tells Izdubar, the giant, how
he built a vessel according to the directions of Hea,
to save himself and his family from the universal
deluge which the gods sent upon the earth to punish
the wickedness of men; how the deluge lasted six
days, and on the seventh, when the storm ceased, the
vessel was stranded for seven days on the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of Nizir; and how on the seventh day, he Hasisadra,
sent out first a dove and then a swallow, both of whom,
finding no resting-place, returned to the vessel, till a
raven was sent forth and did not return; and Hasisadra
sent out the animals to the four winds, and poured out
a libation in thanksgiving, and built an altar on the
summit of the mountain.</p>

<p>The belief in a future life—a belief perhaps first
suggested in that rude state of culture where the
dreaming and waking life are not clearly distinct but
are both equally real—appears to prevail so generally
among the lower races, that it is more difficult to find
instances where it is <i>not</i> found than instances where it
is. The dead who visit the living in their sleep are
not thought of as dead, but as simply invisible; and
for this reason all over the globe it is so common to
bury material things in the graves of the departed, to
serve them in that other world which is so vividly
conceived as but a continuation of this one. The
Red Indian takes his horses, the Greenlander his reindeer,
and both the common requisites of earthly
economy; just as many tribes still take their slaves
and their wives to accompany them on that journey
which, as it is imagined so distinctly, is undertaken
without mystery to a fresh existence. Till lately, in
parts of Sweden, a man’s pipe and tobacco-pouch,
some money and lights, were interred with him; and
at Reichenbach, in Germany, a man’s umbrella and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
goloshes are still placed in his grave.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In Russia
formerly a new pair of shoes was put on the feet of
the dead for the long journey before him, a custom
also found among the natives of California, and the
Christian priest used to place on a man’s breast, as he
lay in his coffin, a pass, which, besides being inscribed
with his Christian name and the dates of his birth
and death, was also a certificate of his baptism, of
the piety of his life, and of his having partaken of the
communion before his death.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> These are but survivals
of savage ideas, which picture the continuation of
consciousness far more vividly than more advanced
religions. The Ahts bury blankets with their dead,
that they may not shiver in the cold ones provided in
the land of Chayher. The Delawar Indian used to
make an opening at the head-end of the coffin, that
the soul of the deceased might go in and out till it
had thoroughly settled on its future place of residence.
When the Chippewyas killed their aged relatives who
could hunt no more, the medicine-song used proves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the simple faith which made the cruel deed an act of
mercy: ‘The Lord of life gives courage. It is true
all Indians know that he loves us, and we give over to
him our father, that he may feel himself young in
another land and able to hunt.’</p>

<p>It is possible, indeed, that in many cases the
attention shown by savages to their dead, by the burial
of property which would have been of use to the survivors,
or by the placing of food on their graves at
periodical feasts, arose rather from fear than from any
kinder motive, dictated by the dread always felt by
the living of the dead and the wish to satisfy them,
if possible, by some peace-offering. The Samoyed
sorcerer, after a funeral, goes through the ceremony of
soothing the departed, that he may not trouble the
survivors nor take their best game; a feeling still
further illustrated by their habit of not taking the dead
out to be buried by the regular hut door, but by a
side-opening, that if possible they may not find their
way back—a habit found also in Greenland and in
many other parts of the world. For the fear of the
dead is a universal sentiment, common no less to the
Abipones, who thought that sorcerers could bring the
dead from their graves to visit the living, or to the
Kaffirs, who think that bad men alone live a second
time and try to kill the living by night, than it is to
the ignorant who still believe in the blood-sucking
vampire, a belief which little more than a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ago amounted to a kind of epidemic in Hungary,
resulting in a general disinterment and the burning
or staking of the suspected bodies. In the sepulture,
therefore, of men with their possessions, it was probably
the original thought that the dead would be
less likely to haunt the dwellings of the living, if they
were not compelled to re-seek upon earth those articles
of daily use which they knew were to be found there.</p>

<p>But the savage belief in a future is very variable;
nor could we expect to find it much affected by ideas
of earthly morality, when such ideas themselves
hardly appear to exist. At most it is men of
rank and courage who live again, while cowards
and the commonalty perish utterly; generally there is
no qualification of any kind. The Bedouins have no
fixed belief at all, some thinking that after death they
are changed into screech-owls, and others that if a
camel is slain on their graves they will return to
life riding on it, but otherwise on foot. All North
American Indians are said to believe in the continual
life of the soul, and, because they think themselves the
highest beings on earth, postulate a hereafter where
all their earthly longings will be satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But they
trouble themselves little about it, thinking that the
god they recognise as supreme is too good to punish
them. Thus the Indians of Arauco look forward to an
eternal life in a beautiful land which lies to the west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
far over the sea, whither souls are taken by the sailor
Tempulazy and where no punishment is expected:
for Pillican, their god, the Lord of the world, would
not inflict pain.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The Tunguz Lapps look on the next
life as simply a continuation of this one; in it there
will be no punishment, for here everyone is as good as
he can be, and the gods kill men reluctantly, but are
thereby satisfied. In the Polynesian future there is a
similar absence of any idea of retribution. There is,
for instance, no moral qualification, but only one of
rank, for Bolotu, that happy land of the dead which
lies far away to the north-west of Tonga, beyond the
reach of Tongan boats and greater than all the
Tongan islands put together, wherein abound beautiful
and useful trees, whose plucked fruit instantly
grows again; where a delicious fragrance fills the air,
and birds of the loveliest colours sit upon the trees;
where the woods swarm with pigs, which are immortal
so long as they are not eaten by the gods. Nothing,
indeed, shows better how independent is imagination
of race than the great similarity of those idealised
earths which constitute the heavens of the most distant
savage tribes. The American Indian, who visits in
a dream the unseen world, reports of it, in language
recalling that of Homer, that it is a land where there is
neither day nor night, where the sun never rises nor
sets; where rain and tomahawks and arrows are never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
seen; where pipes abound everywhere, lying ready to
be smoked; where the earth is ever green, the trees
ever in leaf; where there is no need of bearskin nor of
hut; where, if you would travel, the rivers will take
your boat whithersoever you will, without the need of
rudder or of paddle. And just as in the Tongan
Bolotu the plucked fruit is replaced, so there the goat
voluntarily offers its shoulder to the hungry man, in
full confidence that it will grow again, and the beaver
for the same reason makes a ready sacrifice of its
beautiful tail.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>So far there is no idea of a future life as in any
way affected by this one. But such ideas do exist
among savages, and are extremely interesting as indications
of the growth of their moral ideas. The
quality most necessary for a savage is pre-eminently
courage, and courage, therefore, appearing as the first
recognised virtue, lays first claim, as such, to consideration
hereafter. The Brazilians believed that the
souls of the dead became beautiful birds, whilst cowards
were turned into reptiles. The Minnetarrees held that
there were two villages which received the dead; but
that the cowardly and bad went to the small one,
whilst the brave and good occupied the larger. Among
the Caribs, who entertain the strange fancy that they
have as many souls as they feel nerves in their body,
but that the chief of these resides in the heart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
goes to heaven at death, whilst the others go to the
sea or the woods, we meet again with the reservation of
happiness to the souls of the brave. They alone will
live merrily, dancing, feasting, and talking; they alone
will swim in the great streams, feeling no fatigue; the
Arawaks will either serve them as slaves or wander
about in desert mountains. Somewhat similar was
the faith of the old Mexicans, who divided the future
world into three parts: the first, the House of the
Sun, where the days were spent in joyful attendance
on that luminary, with songs and games and dances,
by such brave soldiers as had died in battle or as
prisoners had been sacrificed to the gods, and by
women who had died in giving children to the community;
the second, the kingdom of Tlalocan, hidden
among the Mexican mountains, not so bright as the
former, but cool and pleasant, and filled with unfailing
pumpkins and tomatoes, reserved for priests and for
children sacrificed to Tlaloc and for all persons killed
by lightning, by drowning, or by sickness; the third,
the kingdom of Mictlauteuctli, reserved for all other
persons, but with nothing said of any punishment
there awaiting them. One of the beliefs in Greenland
is, that heaven is situate in the sky or the moon, and
that the journey thither is so easy that a soul may
reach it the same evening that it quits the body, and
play at ball and dance with those other departed
souls who are encamped round the great lake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
shine in heaven as the northern lights. But others
say that it is only witches and bad people who join
the heavenly lights, where they not only enjoy no
rest, owing to the rapid revolutions of the sky, but
are so plagued with ravens that they cannot keep
them from settling in their hair. They believe that
heaven lies under the earth or sea, where dwells
Torngarsuk, the Creator, with his mother, in perpetual
summer and beautiful sunshine. There the water is
good and there is no night, and there are plenty of
birds, and fish, and seals, and reindeer, all to be caught
at pleasure, or ready cooking in a great kettle; but
these delights are reserved for persons who have done
great deeds and worked steadfastly, who have caught
many whales or seals, who have been drowned at sea,
or have died in childbirth. These persons alone may
hope to join the great company and feast on inconsumable
seals. Even then they must slide for five
days down the blood-stained precipice; and unhappy
they to whom the journey falls in stormy weather or
in winter, for then they may suffer that other death
of total extinction, especially if their survivors disturb
them by their noise or affect them injuriously by the
food they eat. The Kamchadal belief is very curious,
as showing how the idea of compensation in the next
world for the evils of this—an idea already apparent
in the Mexican and Greenland beliefs—may have
served to bridge over the conception of a mere continuance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of life for the soul, and the conception of
an actual retribution awaiting it. They imagine
that the dead come to a place under the earth, where
Haetsch dwells, son of Kutka the Creator, and the first
man who died on earth, now Lord of the under-world
and general receiver of souls. To those who come
dressed in fine furs and drive fat dogs before their
sledges, he gives instead old ragged furs and lean dogs;
but to those who have known poverty on earth he gives
new furs and beautiful dogs and also a better place to
live in than the others. The dead live again as on
earth; their wives are restored to them, they build
ostrogs again, and catch fish, and dance and sing;
there is less storm and snow than above ground, and
more people; indeed, abundance of everything.</p>

<p>It is easy to conceive how, when once the idea
had been reached that the brave deserved compensation
in the next world for their earthly courage, the
poor for their earthly wretchedness, or the sick for
their earthly sufferings, and all men for the misfortune
of premature death, it should also be inferred,
as soon as any criterion between goodness and badness
more refined than the mere difference between
courage and cowardice had been attained, that the
good should have some advantage over the bad, and
from such an inference to a complete theory of retribution
and punishment of the bad the logical steps
seem fairly obvious. Few things, indeed, are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
remarkable among the lower races than the general
absence of the ideas we associate with hell.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> At
most the idea of future punishment is negative, the
lives of slaves and cowards terminating in a total cessation
of consciousness, as opposed to its continuance
for warriors and chiefs. Still, the idea of difficulty
in attaining the blessed abodes, such as that above
noticed as prevalent in Greenland—an idea, as Mr.
Tylor suggests, probably connected with the sun’s passage
across the sky to the west, where the happy land
is so generally figured to lie—is very common, and
from such an idea it is natural to connect the difficulty
of the journey to Paradise with the destruction of
those whose presence in it would mar its blessedness.</p>

<p>The trial of merit, varying with experiences of
physical geography, generally lies either in the passage
of a river or gulf by a narrow bridge, or in the
climbing of a steep mountain. The Choctaws, for
instance, believe that the dead have to pass a long
and slippery pine-log, across a deep and rapid river,
on the other side of which stand six persons, who pelt
new-comers with stones and cause the bad ones to
fall in.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In Khond theology the judge of the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
resides beyond the sea, on the smooth and slippery
Leaping Rock, below which flows a black unfathomable
river; and the souls of men take bold leaps to
reach the rock, those that fail contracting a deformity
which is transferred to the next soul animated on
earth. The Blackfoot Indians, on the other hand,
believe that departed souls have to climb a steep
mountain, from the summit of which is seen a great
plain, with new tents and swarms of game; that the
dwellers in that happy plain advance to them and
welcome those who have led a good life, but reject
the bad—those who have soiled their hands in the
blood of their countrymen—and throw them headlong
from the mountain; whilst women who have been
guilty of infanticide never reach the mountain at all,
but hover round the seat of their crimes with branches
of trees tied to their legs. The Fijians think that
even the brave have some difficulty in reaching the
judgment-seat of Ndengei, and they provide the dead
with war-clubs to resist Sama and his host, who will
dispute their passage. But celibacy is in their eyes
apparently the only offence which calls for peremptory
and hopeless punishment. Unmarried Fijians are
dashed to pieces by Nangananga as in vain attempts
to steal round to a certain reef they are driven ashore
by the rising tide.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The Norwegian Lapps consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that abstinence from stealing, lying, and quarrelling
entitles a man to compensation hereafter. Such
receive after death a new body, and live with the
higher gods in Saiwo, and indulge in hunting and
magic, brandy-drinking and smoking, to a far
higher degree than was possible on earth. Wicked
men, perjurers, and thieves go to the place of the bad
spirits, to Gerre-Mubben-Aimo.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The idea of compensation
of the good leads naturally to the idea of
retribution for the bad; and even among the Guinea
Coast negroes we find future inducements to the practice
of such moral duties as they recognise. For they are
wont to make for themselves idols, called Sumanes
whose favour they endeavour to secure by abstinence
from certain kinds of foods, believing that after death
those who have been constant in their vows of abstinence
and in offerings to the Sumanes will come
to a large inland river, where a god inquires of
everyone how he has lived his days on earth, and those
who have not kept their vows are drowned and destroyed
for ever. The inland-dwelling negroes declare
that at this river dwells a powerful god in a beautiful
house, which, though always exposed, is never touched
by rain. He knows all past and present things; he can
send any kind of weather, he can heal sicknesses and
work miracles. Before him must all the dead appear;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the good to receive a happy and peaceful life, the bad
to be killed for ever by the large wooden club which
hangs before his door. Lastly, it may be noticed that
negro tribes believe that death will take them to the
land of the European and give them the white man’s
skin; but, as they generally paint their devil white,
we cannot be sure that such a change is not rather
dreaded as a punishment for the bad than regarded
as a change for the better.</p>

<p>So far it appears that savages have developed from
the promptings and imaginings of their own minds
some idea of a Creator and of a soul, as well as of a
future to some extent dependent on earthly antecedents.
It is of course difficult to judge how far the
missionaries or travellers, who have mainly supplied
the only evidence we have, may have clearly understood,
or how much they may have unintentionally
imported into, beliefs they represent as purely indigenous.
In many cases a remarkable similarity may
lead us to suspect that the belief is not native, but
implanted at some time by Christian or other influence,
though traces of such influence may be absolutely
wanting or at least not proved. There can, for instance,
be little doubt whence Sissa, the devil of the
Guinea Coast negroes, derived the pair of horns and
long tail with which he is usually depicted. But, on
the other hand, we cannot lay down any rigid canon
for the imaginations of men, nor say that if one belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is identical with another a thousand miles off it must
therefore have been borrowed and cannot be of independent
growth. Indeed, when we reflect on the
limited nature of the mental faculties of savages, on
the limited range of objects for their minds to work
upon, on their childlike fear of the dark and the unseen,
and their still more childlike delight in the indulgence
of their fancy, so far from there being anything strange
in the analogies of thought between distant tribes, the
strangeness would rather be if such analogies did not
exist. It is probable that children tell one another
much the same stories in London as they do at the
Antipodes, and there is no more reason to be surprised
at finding much the same theologies current in Africa
as in Australia or Ceylon. The same sun, which shines
on men’s bodies alike, shines on their minds alike too;
and myths, like dreams, with all the apparent field
for variety in their formation, are really subject to
the closest laws of uniformity and sameness.</p>

<p>We have, however, to be careful, in applying terms
of our own religious phraseology to savage thoughts
and fancies, to discriminate between the higher and
lower meaning they bear, and always to employ them
in the lower. The belief, already noticed, of the
Kamchadals in Kutka well illustrates how different
is the meaning involved in the Kamchadal theory of
creation from that involved in Genesis or the Zend-Avesta.
The same is true of the belief in a soul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
its future life; for the savage, intensely vivid as is
his future beyond the grave, seldom doubts for an
instant but that he will share it with all the rest,
not only of the animate, but of the inanimate world.
For that reason he buries axes, and clothes, and food
with the dead, to be of service in the next world.
The Fijians used to show ‘the souls of men and
women, beasts and plants, of stocks and stones,
canoes and houses, and of all the utensils of this
frail world, swimming, or rather tumbling one over
the other,’ as they were borne by a swift stream
at the bottom of a deep hole to the regions of immortality.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
So of the animate world. The Kamchadal
believes that the smallest fly that breathes will rise
after death to live again in the under-world.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> If the
Laplander expects that all honest people will re-meet
in Aimo, he as fully expects that bears and wolves
will meet there too. The Greenlander believes that
all the heavenly bodies were once Greenlanders, <i>or
animals</i>, and that they shine with a pale or red light
according to the food they ate on earth. He also
believes that when all things now living on the earth
are dead, and the earth cleansed from their blood by
a great water-flood; when the purified dust is consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
again by a great wind, and a fairer earth, all
plain and no cliffs, is substituted for the present one;
when Priksoma, he who is above, breathes on men
that they may live again—then animals will also rise
again and be in great abundance. The old inhabitants
of Anahuac and Egypt believed equally that animals
would share the next world with them; and, if the
universality of an opinion were any reason for its
credibility, few opinions could claim a better title to
acceptance than this one. So confident were the
Swedish Lapps of the future life of animals, that
whenever they killed one in sacrifice they buried the
bones in a box, that the gods might more easily restore
it to life.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> There is really nothing very unnatural in
this idea, when we remember that in the lower stages
of culture man not only admits the equality of
brutes with himself, but even acknowledges their
superiority by actual worship of them. It is not
difficult to understand how it is that savages who see
deities in everything, in the motionless mountain or
stone no less than in the rushing river or wind, should
see in animals deities of extraordinary power, whose
capacities infinitely transcend their own. Recognising
as they do in the tiger a strength, in the deer a speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in the monkey a cunning, all superior to their own,
they naturally conceive of them as deities whom above
all others it is expedient to humour by adoration and
sacrifice. Some negro tribes, holding that all animals
enshrine a spirit, which may injure or benefit
themselves, will refrain from eating certain animals,
otherwise perfectly edible, and endeavour to propitiate
them by lifelong attention. Thus some regularly
offer food at the earth-houses of termites, or fatten
sheep and goats, for a purely temporary and perfectly
spiritual advantage. It is on account of their divine
and immortal nature that the well-known custom
of apologising to animals killed in the chase is so
general among savages. It is generally a deprecation
of any post-mortem vindictiveness on the part of the
animal’s ghost. The natives of Greenland refrain
from breaking seals’ heads or throwing them into the
sea; but they pile them in a heap before their hut
door, that the souls of the seals may not be angry
and in their spite frighten living seals away. The
Yuracares of Bolivia were careful to put small fish-bones
carefully aside, lest fish should disappear; and
other Indian tribes would keep the bones of beavers
and sables from their dogs for a year and then bury
them, lest the spirits of those animals should take
offence and no more of them be killed or trapped.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The Lapps are so afraid that the soul of the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
whose flesh they have killed may take its revenge as
a disembodied spirit, that before eating it they not only
entreat pardon for its death, but perform the ceremony
of treating it first with nuts or other delicacies, that
it may be led to believe it is present as a guest—not
to be eaten, but to eat. Another Kamchadal fancy
indicates how savages, whose theory of cause and
effect appears to be that it is quite sufficient for two
things to be connected contemporaneously for one to
be cause and the other effect, are led more especially
to see deities in birds, from the observation that
changes in weather are associated with their arrival
and departure. Since to be associated with a thing
is to be caused by it, migratory birds take away
or bring the summer with them. For the reason
that the spring and the wagtails return together the
Kamchadal thanks the wagtail for bringing back the
spring, and it is probably from a similar confusion
of thought that he thanks the ravens and crows for
fine weather.</p>

<p>Whether, in conclusion, it be true or not that the
more civilised nations of the earth have gone through
stages of growth in which their religious conceptions
resembled those of contemporary savage tribes, one
result at least is clear, that the actual standpoint of
the savage with regard to the great mysteries of
existence is removed <i>toto cœlo</i> from that of Christian,
or Mahometan, or Parsee. The Creator he believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in is not so much the cause of all things as the maker
of some things, because seemingly the first father of
men needed the wherewithal to exercise his energies.
The savage’s soul is simply his breath or ghost,
which indeed will survive his body, but which may
lose its identity in the body of an animal or thing,
destined like himself to live again. He conceives of
himself generally as not mortal, but not therefore
as immortal. His future is but a repetition of his
present, with the same base wants and pursuits, only
with a greater possibility of indulgence, and not
necessarily indefinite in duration. It is, perhaps,
some compensation for this, that, if it does not hold
out great hopes, its prospect serves to deprive death
of its terror, and brightens the sufferings of the passing
day. To the native American death is said to
be rather an event of gladness than of terror, bringing
him rest or enjoyment after his period of toil; nor
does he fear to go to a land ‘which all his life long
he has heard abounds in rewards without punishments.’<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
No thought of possibly flying from present
evils to find immeasurably greater ones awaiting him
after death would ever occur to a savage, and he will
even kill himself or cheerfully submit to be killed
by his friends, in order to realise the sooner the
difference imagined between earth and heaven. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
powers of evil which vex him here will be absent
hereafter, and the Spirit he recognises as supreme in
his hierarchy of invisible powers is either conceived
as too beneficent to punish, or, if he punishes at all,
as likely to punish at once and for ever.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>SAVAGE MODES OF PRAYER.</i></span></h2>

<p>In the same way as a child is insensibly educated by
the very efforts of an adult to place himself on its
level, so any tribe of savages is to some extent
modified by the time that a stranger has fitted himself,
by long residence among them and the acquisition
of their language, to tell us anything about them.
This primary difficulty, amounting theoretically to insuperability,
might alone suffice to invalidate most
of the received evidence which asserts or denies
concerning savages anything whatsoever in broad
general terms. But when the evidence concerns
religious ideas another difficulty is superadded, and
one which appertains to the subject of religion alone—the
reserve, that is, (attested by too many travellers
to need specific references,) with which savages guard
their stock of fundamental beliefs. The delicacy
manifested by the most skilled of the Iowa Indian
tribe as to communicating fully or freely on religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
subjects, lest they should bring on themselves or their
nation some great calamity,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> indicates the feeling that
probably underlies such religious reticence. If a
savage dare not pronounce his own name, much less
the names of his dead, it is a fair matter of wonder
that he should ever have become so free with the names
and attributes of his divinities as to have rendered it
possible for such systematic representations of his
theology as are current to appear before the world.</p>

<p>The evidence afforded by ethnology as to the
nature of prayer among savages is slighter than on
most subjects relating to them, partly from the
natural disregard paid to such matters by most
Christian missionaries, partly from the secret and
hidden character of prayer, which alone would make
its study impossible; but there is abundant evidence
to show that religious supplication of a certain kind
enters more deeply than might be supposed into the
daily lives of the lower races of mankind. Says Ellis
of the Society Islanders: ‘Religious rites were connected
with almost every act of their lives. An <i>ubu</i> or
prayer was offered before they ate their food, planted
their gardens, built their houses, launched their canoes,
cast their nets, and commenced or concluded a
journey.’<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In the Fijian Islands business transactions
were commonly terminated by a short wish or prayer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and in the Sandwich Islands the priest would pray
before a battle that the gods he addressed would
prove themselves stronger than the gods of his foes,
promising them hecatombs of victims in the event of
victory. But the mere fact of such prayers is of
less interest than the actual formulas used; these,
however, have more rarely been thought worth
recording.</p>

<p>According to a recent African traveller it is a
daily prayer in some parts of Guinea: ‘O God, I
know thee not, but thou knowest me: thy aid is
necessary to me.’ Or again: ‘O God, help us; we
do not know whether we shall live to-morrow: we are
in thy hand.’<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> A Bushman, being asked how he
prayed to Cagn (recognised by his tribe as the first
being and creator of all things), answered, in a low,
imploring tone: ‘O Cagn, O Cagn, are we not
your children? do you not see our hunger? Give us
food;’ ‘and,’ he added, ‘he gives us both hands full.’<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
It further appears that the Bushmen address petitions
to the sun, to the moon, and to the stars;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and the
Kamchadals, who have been made to dispute with
them the lowest rank of humanity, had a rude form of
prayer to the Storm-god, which was uttered by a
small child, sent naked round the ostrog with a shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in its uplifted hand: ‘Gsanlga, sit down and cease to
storm; the mussel is accustomed to salt, not to sweet
water; you make me too wet, and from the wet I
must freeze. I have no clothes; see how I freeze.’<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
In a certain African tribe it is said to be usual for
the men to go every morning to a river, and there,
after splashing water in their faces, or throwing sand
over their heads, after clasping and loosing their hands
and whispering softly the words <i>Eksuvais</i>, to pray:
‘Give me to-day rice and yams, gold and aggry-beads,
slaves, riches, and health; make me active and
strong.’<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The Zulus of Africa and the Khonds of India
supply good illustrations of savage prayer. The head
man of a Zulu village, at the sacrifice of a bullock to
the spirits of the dead, thus addresses them in prayer:
‘I pray for cattle that they may fill this pen. I pray
for corn that many people may come to this village
of yours and make a noise and glorify you. I also
ask for children, that this village may have a large
population and that your name may never come to an
end.’<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The Khonds, also, at the sacrifice of a bullock
express their wishes with rather more emphasis:
‘Let our herds be so numerous that they cannot be
housed; let children so abound that care of them shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
overcome their parents, as shall be seen by their burnt
hands.’ Or, again, they will ask that their swine
may so abound that their fields shall require no
other ploughs than their ‘rooting snouts;’ that their
poultry may be so numerous as to hide the thatch
of their houses; that neither fish, frog, nor worm
shall be able to live in their drinking ponds beneath
the trampling feet of their multitude of cattle.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>These may be taken as fair samples of primitive
prayer; but it is only just, as against the inference
that a savage’s prayers have reference solely to the
good and evil things of this world, to notice indications
of higher sentiments. The Yebus of Africa, with faces
bowed to the earth, are said commonly to pray, not
only for preservation from sickness and death, but
for the gifts of happiness and <i>wisdom</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The Tahitian
priest, praying to the god by whom it was supposed
that a dead man’s spirit had been required, that the
sins of the latter, especially that one for which he had
lost his life, might be buried in a hole then dug
in the ground and not attach to the survivors, points
to the occasional presence of a moral motive in prayer;
though even here the deprecation of further anger on
the part of the gods appears the principal object of
concern.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> So little indeed do thoughts of morality
or of a future state enter as factors into savage prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and so little does any ethical distinction appear in the
savage conception of supernatural powers, that not
unfrequently supplication is directed to the attainment
of ends morally the reverse of desirable. Like the
Roman tradesman praying to Mercury to aid him in
cheating, the Nootka warrior would entreat his god
that he might find his foes asleep, and so kill a great
many of them.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But perhaps the best illustration of
the perverted use of prayer is one employed by a clan of
the Hervey Islanders when engaged on a thieving and
murdering expedition, and uttered as near as possible
to the dwelling of the person about to be robbed. It
is apparently addressed to Rongo, or Oro, the great
Polynesian god of war, and is thus translated in Mr.
Gill’s ‘Myths and Songs of the South Pacific’:—<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">We are on a thieving expedition;</div>
<div class="verse">Be close to our left side to give aid.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Let all be wrapped in sleep;</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The god is then entreated to cause all things to sleep;
the owner of the house is entreated to sleep on, likewise
the threshold of the house, the insects, beetles,
earwigs, and ants that inhabit it, the central post, the
several rafters and beams that support it; and after
the thatch of the house has been asked to sleep on,
the prayer thus concludes:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>If, however, we may hope to find anywhere indications
of a higher purpose in prayer than the attainment
of merely temporary or personal needs, we must
seek it (nor is the search entirely vain) in those rites
of religion which, from the highest to the lowest levels
of culture, are customary upon the entrance of a fresh
life on the stage of this world’s trials and sorrows.
The popular saying, that the cries of a child at its
christening are the cries of the devil going out of
it, expresses identically the same belief which still
prompts our savage contemporaries to drive evil
spirits from a new-born child by rites of mysterious
spiritual efficacy; and it is probably to the indigenous
prevalence of baptism among many savage tribes that
some Catholic missionaries, complacently identifying
conversion with immersion, have owed the success of
their efforts. It would at least be interesting to know
whether baptism was a native African rite at the time
that the Capuchin Merolla baptized with his own
hands 13,000 negroes, and Padre Jerom da Montefarchio
his 100,000 in the space of twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Mungo Park gives an account of a purely heathen
festival held about a week after the birth of a child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
at which a priest, taking the latter in his arms, would
pray, soliciting repeatedly the blessing of God on the
child and all the company. And Bosman tells of a
priest binding ropes, corals, and other things round
the limbs of a new-born child, and exorcising the
spirits of sickness and evil.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It cannot, however, be proved with certainty that
such rites are of native growth wherever they have
been found, though similar feelings of natural impurity,
of natural anxiety, may well have contributed to
make them common all the world over. With this
reservation, let it suffice to recall some illustrations
drawn from the most distant parts of the world.
The most touching form of the custom is told of a
tribe in the Fiji Islands, where the priest, presented
by the relations with food with which to notify
the event to the gods before the birth-festival,
would thus petition the latter: ‘This is the food of
the little child: take knowledge of it, ye gods. Be kind
to him. Do not pelt him or spit upon him, or seize
him, but let him live to plant sugar-canes.’<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In New
Zealand, the tohunga, or priest, dipping a green branch
into a calabash of water, sprinkled the child therewith
and made incantations according to its sex;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> whilst in
the Hervey Islands, where the child was immersed in
a taro leaf filled with water, the ceremony was intimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
connected with their system of tribes and
dedication for future sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Crossing over to
America, we find among the Indian tribes of Guiana
the native priest dancing about an infant and dashing
water over it, finishing the ceremony by passing his
hands over its limbs, muttering all the while incantations
and charms.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In some North American tribes,
water having been boiled with a certain sweet-scented
root, and some of it having been first thrown into the
fire and the rest distributed to the company by the
oldest woman present, the latter would then offer a
short prayer to the Master of Life, on behalf of the
child, that its life might be spared and that it might
grow; and if, at the festival held to commemorate
the child’s first slain animal, one of the chief persons
present would entreat the Great Spirit to be kind to
the lad and let him grow to be a great hunter, in war
to take many scalps and not to behave like an old
woman, it cannot be said that such a prayer was
purely selfish in its aim or confined solely to present
necessities.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Although, however, it is impossible to dissociate
baptismal rites so rude as these from a belief in magic,
the idea of water as conferring moral as well as physical
purity appears to have been attained by some of
the more advanced heathen tribes. The rite of baptism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
says Dr. Brinton, was of immemorial antiquity
among the Cherokees, Aztecs, Mayas, and Peruvians:
the use of water as symbolical of spiritual cleansing
clearly appearing, for instance, in the prayer of the
Peruvian Indian, who after confessing his guilt would
bathe in the river and say: ‘O river, receive the
sins I have this day confessed unto the sun, carry
them down to the sea, and let them never more
appear.’<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It has often been told, on the original
authority of Sahagun, how the Mexican nurse, after
bathing the new-born child, would bid it approach its
mother, the goddess of water; praying at the same
time to her that she would receive it and wash it,
would take away its inherited impurity, make it
good and clean, and instil into it good habits and
manners.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The mere enunciation of a wish often amounts
among savages to a complete prayer, it being conceived
that the expression of desire is of more
moment than the manner of such expression; such a
conception still surviving among ourselves at certain
wishing towers, wishing gates, or on the occurrence of
certain natural phenomena. In Fiji it was common
to shout aloud, after drinking a toast, the name of
some object of desire, and this was equivalent to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
prayer for whatever it might be—for food, wealth, a
fair wind, or even for the gratification of cannibal
gluttony. Franklin tells how some Indians, disappointed
in the chase, set themselves to beat a large
tambourine and sing an address to the Great Spirit,
praying for relief, their prayer consisting solely of
three words constantly repeated;<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the tambourine probably
being employed for the same purpose that the
Sioux Indians kept a whistle in the mouth of one of
their gods, namely, to make their invocation audible.
The Ahts, praying to the moon, sometimes say no
more than <i>teech, teech</i>, that is, Health or Life; and it
is curious that the rude savages of Brazil exclaim <i>teh,
teh</i>, to the same luminary.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The Sioux would often
say, ‘Spirits of the dead, have mercy!’ adding thereto
a notification of their wishes, whether for good
health, good luck in hunting, or anything else.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The Zulus, however, sometimes carry this principle of
brevity furthest, for sometimes in their prayers to the
spirits of their dead they simply say, ‘Ye people of
our house,’ ‘the suppliant taking it for granted that
the Amatongo will know what he wants;’ though
generally their addresses to their ancestors are of a
much more orthodox length than this.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> When we
consider how large a place the spirits of the dead fill in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the savage’s spirit-world it appears possible that many
of the prayers and sacrifices, said to be offered to the
Great Spirit or unknown divinities, are really addressed
to the all-controlling, ever-present spirits of the
departed.</p>

<p>If we may believe the testimony of a great many
travellers in all parts of the world, the case of the
Yezidis, who to the recognition of a supreme being
are said to join actual worship of the chief power of
evil, represents no exceptional phase of human
thought. Yet even the Yezidis, according to Dr.
Latham, are said to be improperly called Devil-worshippers,
since they only try to conciliate Satan,
speak of him with respect or not at all, avoid his
name in all their oaths, and are pained if they hear
people make a light use of it.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In Equatorial Africa
it is said that whilst Mburri, the spirit of evil, is
worshipped piously as a tyrant to be appeased, it is
not considered necessary to pray to Njambi, the good
spirit.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Harmon says distinctly of all the different
Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains that they
pray and make frequent and costly sacrifices to the
bad spirit for delivery from evils they feel or fear,
but that they seldom pray to the supreme good spirit,
to whom they ascribe every perfection, and whom
they consider too benevolent ever to inflict evil on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his creatures.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> There is, indeed, little doubt that, if a
certain amount of evidence suffices the requirements
of proof, we must yield consent to the fact, in itself
neither incredible nor unintelligible, that many savage
tribes, recognising and believing in a good and
powerful spirit, make that very goodness a reason for
their neglect of him, and address their petitions
instead to the mercy of that other spirit to whose
power for evil they conceive the world to lie subject.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
There is, however, much to be said in favour of the
view, that the mind in its primitive state is unconscious
of this moral dualism in the spirit-world, attributing
rather (in perfect accordance with the analogy
of human relationships) good and bad things alike to
the agency of the same beings, according as transitory
impulses affect them.</p>

<p>Thus, according to Castren, an antagonism
between absolute good and absolute evil finds no
place among the Samoyeds. They have no extreme
divinities corresponding in their attributes to Ahriman
and Ormuzd. ‘The human temper is the divine
temper also, good and bad mixed.’<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Mburri, who,
according to one writer, is the evil spirit in Equatorial
Africa, is, according to another, the good spirit, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
least the less wicked of the two, both the good and
bad receiving worship, and being endowed with much
the same powers.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The Beetjuans, venerating Morimo
as the source of all good and evil that happened to
them, were not agreed as to whether he was entirely
a beneficent or a malevolent being; and, if they
thanked him for benefits, they never hesitated to
curse him for ills or for wishes unfulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> ‘To the
very same image,’ says Bosman of the negroes, ‘they
at one time make offerings to God and at another to
the devil, so that one image serves them in the
capacity of god and devil.’ It was untrue, he declares,
that the negroes prayed and made offerings
to the devil, though some of them would try to
appease a devil by leaving thousands of pots of
victuals standing ever ready for his gratification; on
the contrary, the devil was annually banished from
their towns with great ceremony, being hunted away
with dismal cries, and his spirit pelted with wood and
stones.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The evidence, again, in this respect concerning the
aborigines of America is important. The Winnebagoes
are said to have had a tradition that soon after
the creation a bad spirit appeared on the scene, whose
attempts to vie with the products of the Good Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
resulted in making a negro in failure of an Indian,
a grizzly bear in failure of a black one, and snakes
which were endowed with venom; he also it was who
made all the worthless trees, thistles, and weeds, who
tempted Indians to lie, murder, and steal, and who
receives bad Indians when they die. The suspicion,
however, of Christian influence among this tribe
makes the tradition of little value to the argument.
Turning to other evidence, amid Schoolcraft’s reiterated
statements of the original dualism of Indian
theology, whereby the Indian was careful ‘to guard
his good and merciful God from all evil acts and
intentions, by attributing the whole catalogue of evil
deeds among the sons of men to the Great Bad Spirit
of his theology,’ we yet find this admission, that ‘it is
impossible to witness closely the rites and ceremonies
which the tribes practise in their sacred and ceremonial
societies without perceiving that <i>there is no very accurate
or uniform discrimination between the powers of
the two antagonistical deities</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Mr. Pond, who resided
with the Sioux Indians for eighteen years and had
every opportunity to become acquainted with such
matters, declares that it was ‘next to impossible to
penetrate’ into the subject of their divinities; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was never able to discover ‘the least degree of evidence
that they divide the gods into classes of good
and evil,’ nor did he believe that they ever distinguished
the Great Spirit from other divinities ‘till
they learnt to do so from intercourse with the
whites;’ for they had no chants, feasts, dances, nor
sacrificial rites which had any reference to such a
being, or which, if they had, were not of recent origin.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Of the same people says Mr. Prescott, a man related
to and resident among them many years: ‘As to
their belief in evil spirits, they do not understand the
difference between a great good spirit and a great
evil spirit, as we do. <i>The idea the Indians have is
that a spirit can be good if necessary, and do evil if it
thinks fit.</i>’ They ‘know very little about whether the
Great Spirit has anything to do with their affairs,
present or future.’ Their idea of the Great Spirit is
of the vaguest possible kind, since they lack entirely
any conception of his power, or of the mode of, or of
a reason for, man’s creation. The Great Spirit they
believe made everything but the wild rice and the
thunder; and they have been known to accuse their
deity of badness in sending storms to cause them
misery.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In the same way the Comanches of Texas
neither worship the evil spirit nor are aware of his
existence, ‘<i>attributing everything to arise from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Great Spirit, whether of good or evil</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Had the
ancient Jews been described by Greek travellers instead
of by themselves, we may fairly suspect that
they would have been introduced to posterity as a
people, consciously theistic indeed, but at the same
time as addicted, in most of their rites, to demonolatry
and the propitiation of imaginary evil beings. The
true view would seem to be that the theology of the
lower races does not admit of that preciseness of
terminology, of that clear distinction of qualities, of
that systematic marshalling of powers, which has
been so often predicated of it, but that in its growth
it undergoes a period of flux and change similar to
that which may be seen to occur in the evolution of
the lowest forms of physical life into more determinate
types of being.</p>

<p>The Sioux Indians, abusing their Great Spirit for
sending them storms, or the Kamschadals cursing
Kutka for having created their mountains so high and
their streams so rapid, expose a state of thought relating
to the gods which is most difficult to reconcile
with the savage’s habitual dread of them, still more
with a high conception of them, but which is too
well authenticated to admit of doubt. Franklin saw
a Cree hunter tie offerings (a cotton handkerchief,
looking-glass, tin pin, some ribbon and tobacco) to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the value of twenty skins round an image of the god
Kepoochikan, at the same time praying to him in a
rapid monotonous tone to be propitious, explaining to
him the value of his presents, and strongly cautioning
him against ingratitude.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> If all the prayers and presents
made to their god by the Tahitians to save their
chiefs from dying proved in vain, his image was inexorably
banished from the temple and destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
The Ostiaks of Siberia, if things went badly with
them, would pull down from their place of honour in
the hut and in every way maltreat the idols they
generally honoured so exceedingly; the idols whose
mouths were always so diligently smeared with fish-fat,
and within whose reach a supply of snuff ever lay
ready.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The Chinese are said to do the same by
their household gods, if for a long time they are deaf
to their prayers, and so do the Cinghalese;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> so that
the practice is more than an impulsive manifestation of
merely local feeling. That such feelings occasionally
crop out in civilised Catholic countries is matter of
more surprise; but it is an authentic historical fact
that the good people of Castelbranco, in Portugal,
were once so angry with St. Anthony for letting the
Spaniards plunder their town, contrary to his agreement,
that they broke many of his statues in pieces,
and, taking the head off one they specially revered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
substituted for it the head of St. Francis.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Neapolitan
fishermen are said to this day to throw their saints
overboard if they do not help them in a storm; and
the images of the Virgin or of St. Januarius, worn in
Neapolitan caps, are in danger of being trodden under
foot and destroyed, if adverse contingencies arise. The
latter saint, indeed, once received during a famine
very clear intimation, that, unless corn came by a certain
time, he would forfeit his saintship.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is perhaps a refinement of thought when a
present becomes an advisable accompaniment to a
simple petition; but the principle of exchange once
entered into, the relations between man and the
supernatural lead logically from the offering of fruits
and flowers to the sacrifice of animals and of men.
Some Algonkin Indians, mistaking once a missionary
for a god, and petitioning his mercy, begged him to let
the earth yield them corn, the rivers fish, and to prevent
sickness from slaying or hunger from tormenting them.
Their request they backed with the offer of a pipe;<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
and in this ridiculous incident the whole of the savage’s
philosophy of sacrifice is contained. Prescott, coming
with some Indians to a lake they were to cross, saw
his companions light their pipes and smoke by way
of invoking the winds to be calm.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> And the Hurons
offered a similar prayer with tobacco to a local god,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
saying: ‘Oki, thou who livest on this spot, we offer
thee tobacco. Help us, save us from shipwreck.
Defend us from our enemies. Give us good trade,
and bring us safe back to our villages.’<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In the
island of Tanna, the village priest, addressing the
spirits of departed chiefs (thought to preside over the
growth of yams and fruits), after the firstfruits of
vegetation had been deposited on a stone, on the
branch of a tree, or on a rude altar of sticks, would
pray: ‘Compassionate father, here is some food; eat
it, be kind to us on account of it;’ and in Samoa, too,
a libation of ava at the evening meal was the offering,
in return for which the father of a family would beg
of the gods health and prosperity, productiveness for
his plantations, and for his tribe generally a strong
and large population for war.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> In Fiji, again, when
the chief priests and leading men assembled to
discuss public affairs in the yaquona or kava circle,
the chief herald, as the water was poured into the
kava, after naming the gods for whom the libation was
prepared, would say: ‘Be gracious, ye lords, the gods,
that the rain may cease, and the sun shine forth;’
and again when the potion was ready: ‘Let the gods
be of a gracious mind, and send a wind from the
east.’<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a somewhat obvious inference, if presents
like these fail to obtain corresponding results, that
the spirit addressed is not satisfied, and that he
requires a greater value in exchange for the blessings
at his disposal. The crowning petition, therefore, of
disappointed and despairing humanity is, by an
irrefragable chain of reasoning, the sacrifice of a
human life, or, if this fails, of many lives. Long and
frequent were the prayers of the Tahitians to the
gods when their chiefs were ill, for, under the idea
that ‘the gods were always influenced by the same
motives as themselves, they imagined that the efficacy
of their prayers would be in exact proportion to the
value of the offerings with which they were accompanied.’
Hence, if the disease grew violent, the fruits
of whole plantain fields or more than a hundred pigs
would be hurried to the marae; nay, not unfrequently
a number of men with ropes round their
necks would be led to the altar and presented to the
idol, with prayers that the mere sight of them might
satisfy his wrath.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It does not appear that on such
occasions they were actually slain, but we seem here
rather to see the first step towards human sacrifice than
merely a survival of it, for the obtaining of this particular
wish. The process is naturally from the sacrifice of
the least possible to the sacrifice of the greatest possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
though after that point has been reached there may
well be a tendency, varying with the character of a
tribe, to fall back upon make-believe, curtailed losses.
The Mandan Indians, Catlin repeats, always sacrificed
the best of its kind to the Great Spirit, the favourite
horse, the best arrow, or the best piece of buffalo;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
so that the sacrifice of their fingers was more probably
a form of incipient human sacrifice than, as it sometimes
is, a relic of a more complete self-surrender.
Both the Aztecs and the Mayas, with all the cruel
forms of sacrifice that disgraced their civilization,
retained traditions of a time when the gods were contented
with the milder offerings of fruits and flowers;
and in Yucatan, where hundreds of young girls were
sacrificed in the dark but sacred pit of Chichen, there
were recollections of a time when one victim sufficed
the demands of the spirit-world. And in this instance
may be seen how human sacrifice, besides being the
highest gift man could offer to his god or gods, was
in yet another sense a mode of prayer; for whilst the
victims stood round the pit, whilst the incense burnt
on the altar and in the braziers, the officiating priest
explained to the messengers from earth ‘the things for
which they were to implore the gods into whose presence
they were about to be introduced.’<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> So also the
priests of Mexico would exhort the deputation of eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
souls they sent to the sun to remember the mission
for which they were sent, the people’s wants they were
to make known, the favours they were to ask for their
countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Less obviously connected with prayer than sacrifice
is dancing, a custom which the civilized world
has long since ceased to regard as in any sense
connected with religion, but which among savages,
besides being a natural expression of joy in life, of
thankfulness for sun or shower, is not unfrequently a
mode of prayer, a means employed for the attainment
of desire. This at least seems the case with those
imitative dances or pantomimes in which with marvellous
exactitude the savage all the world over acts
the part of the animals he pursues in the chase. The
national dance of the Kamschadals consists in the
imitation of the manners and motions of seals and
bears, varying from the gentlest movement of their
bodies to the most violent agitation of their thighs
and knees, accompanied with singing and stamping
in time;<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and it is remarkable that in Vancouver’s
Island also there is a seal dance, for which the
natives, stripping themselves naked, enter the water,
regardless of the cold of the night, and emerge
‘dragging their bodies along the sand like seals,’ then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
enter the houses and crawl about the fires, and finally
jump up and dance about.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>But although it is intelligible that such facility
and perfection of beast-acting as, for instance, enabled
the Dog-rib Indians to approach and kill the reindeer,
acquired originally by the necessities of the
chase, should be perpetuated as a religious ceremony
to keep up a habit of actual importance to existence,
there are cases to which this explanation would hardly
apply, as, for example, to the African gorilla dance,
which has been so vividly described by a recent eye-witness,
and which, he says, ‘was a religious festival
held on the eve of an enterprise,’ the eve, namely, of
a gorilla hunt. An African dancing to a drum and
harp imitated closely all the attitudes and movements
of the gorilla, being joined in the chorus by all the
rest present. ‘Now he would be seated on the
ground, his legs apart, his hands resting on his knees,
his head drooping, and in his face the vacant expression
of the brute. Sometimes he folded his arms on
his forehead. Suddenly he would raise his head with
prone ears and flaming eyes,’ till in the last act he
represented the gorilla attacked and killed.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> But,
unless gorillas are ever killed by so clever an imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of themselves that they really mistake their
African neighbours for their own brothers, the gorilla
dance must, by a phenomenon of thought not without
analogy, be a mode of prayer for obtaining a desired
result; the same fetishistic law of thought prevailing
that is traceable in the idea that by pouring water on
a stone you can bring rain on the earth, or that you
can injure your enemy by an injury to his effigy.</p>

<p>It may be, however, that pantomimic dances were
employed originally as a clearer expression than
mere words of the suppliant’s wishes, the acting of a
hunt or battle being equivalent to a petition for
favour and success in the same, and the unseen deities
addressed being not unnaturally conceived as more
likely to see the bodily movements than to hear the
feeble voice of the petitioner. The analogy of the
various tongues, prevalent among birds, beasts, and
men, might well suggest to a savage the possibility
of the spiritual world being unavoidably deaf to his
utterances from mere inability to comprehend them;
whilst dealings with the nearest tribe might make it
natural for him to resort to the use of signs and
symbols as the least mistakable vehicle for his meaning.
The Ahts, retiring to the solitude of the woods,
and there standing naked with outstretched arms before
the moon, employ set words and gestures according
to the nature of the object they desire. Thus in
praying for salmon the suppliant rubs the back of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hands, and, looking upwards, says, ‘Many salmon,
many salmon;’ in asking for deer he carefully rubs
both his eyes, for geese the back of his shoulders, for
bears his sides and legs, uttering in a sing-song way the
usual formula. The meaning of all these rubbings is
obscure; but it has been suggested that the rubbing
of the hands indicates a wish that the hand may
have the requisite steadiness for throwing the salmon
spear; the rubbing of the eyes, a prayer, that they
may be opened to discern deer in the forest.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Among a Californian tribe it was usual, preparatory
to the chase, to resort to a certain stake-inclosure
and there to pray to the god’s image for success, by
mimicry of the actions of the hunt, as by leaping and
twanging of the bow.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In the Society Islands, if the
land had been in any way defiled by an enemy, a
mode of religious purification consisted in offering
pieces of coral, collected expressly, on the altar to
the gods, to induce them ‘to cleanse the land from
pollution, that it might be pure as the coral fresh
from the sea.’<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The Voguls, whose most frequent prayers are for
success in hunting, are said to promote their fulfilment
by ‘<i>images in the shape of the beast more especially
sought for, rudely shaped out of wood or stone</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But
to dance like the animal would naturally serve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
purpose as well; and so the interpretation of some
dances as symbolised prayers explains several
American customs which are strikingly analogous to
the African gorilla dance already described. Every
Mandan Indian was compelled by social law to keep
his buffalo’s mask, consisting of the skin and horns of
a buffalo’s head, in his lodge, ready to put on and wear
in the buffalo dance, whenever the protracted absence
of that animal from the prairie rendered it expedient
to resort to this means for the purpose of inducing
the herds to change the direction of their wanderings
and bend their course towards the Mandan villages.
And a principal part in the annual celebration of the
subsidence of the great waters consisted in the buffalo
dance, wherein eight men dressed in entire buffalo
skins, so as to imitate closely the appearance and
motions of buffaloes, were the chief actors, and four
old men chanted prayers to the Great Spirit for the
continuation of his favours in sending them good
supplies of buffaloes for the coming year.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In this
instance the close relation between dance and prayer,
the dance being either supplementary or explicative,
clearly appears; as it also does in a very similar
buffalo dance performed by a neighbouring tribe of
the Mandans, the Minnatarees. In their ceremony six
elderly men acted the animals, imitating with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
perfection even the peculiar sound of their voice.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Behind them came a man, who represented the driving
of the beasts forward, and who, at a certain point,
placing his hands before his face, sang, and made a
long speech in the nature of a prayer, containing good
wishes for the buffalo hunt and for war, as also an
appeal to the heavenly powers to be propitious to
the huntsmen and their arms. So again the Sioux
Indians for several days before starting on a bear
hunt would hold a bear dance, which was regarded as
‘a most important and indispensable form,’ and in
which the whole tribe joined in a song to the Bear
Spirit, to conciliate as well as to consult him. ‘All
with the motions of their hands closely imitated the
movements of that animal; some representing its
motion in running, and others the peculiar attitude
and hanging of the paws when it is sitting up on its
hind feet and looking out for the approach of an
enemy.’<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And the same tribe, whenever they had
bad luck in hunting, would institute a dance to invoke
the aid of one of their gods.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>To the African gorilla dance, the Mandan buffalo
dance, the Sioux bear dance, may be added the
custom of the Koossa Kafirs, who, before they start
on a hunt, perform a wonderful game, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
considered absolutely necessary to the success of
the undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> One of them, representing some
kind of game, takes a handful of grass in his mouth
and runs about on all fours; whilst the rest make-believe
to transfix him with their spears, till at last he
throws himself on the ground as if he were killed.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
On the occasion of a Sioux Indian dreaming of the
fish-eating cormorant, a fish dance was instituted, to
ward off any danger portended, in which the most
elaborate imitation of the cormorant was observed.
The medicine-men, dancing up to a fish, affixed to a
pole, began quacking, flapping their arms like wings,
biting at the fish, and pretending to hide a piece in
their nests away from the wolves.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The Ahts, again,
Sproat observed, spent the eve of a deer hunt ‘in
dancing and singing and in various ceremonies intended
to secure good luck on the morrow.’<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> And
in South Australia it is remarkable that, when boys
of a certain age undergo the ceremony of losing
their front teeth, power is conferred on them of
killing the kangaroo by a kind of kangaroo dance.
First of all, a kangaroo of grass is deposited at
their feet; and then the actors, the adults of the tribe,
having fitted themselves with long tails of grass, set
off ‘as a herd of kangaroos, now jumping along, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
lying down and scratching themselves, as those animals
do when basking in the sun,’ two armed men
following them meanwhile, as it were to steal on them
unmolested and spear them.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The same thought occurs in prayers for rain.
Modern Servian peasants, pouring water over a girl
covered with grass and flowers, employ a mode of petition
for rain very similar to that in vogue near Lake
Nyanza. There, after a wild dance, a jar of water
is placed before the village chief: the woman who
acts as priestess of the ceremonies washes her hands,
arms, and face with the water; then a large quantity
of it is poured over her, and finally all the women
present rush to dip their calabashes in the jar and to
toss the water in the air with loud cries and wild
gesticulations.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Again, the common savage war dance may be
taken to have a religious significance in addition to
its secular motive of sustaining martial feelings and
habits. In the war dance of the Navajoes of New
Mexico the most important part of the war dance
was the arrow dance, when a young virgin, beautifully
dressed, represented in gesture ‘the war path.’ An
eye-witness has described it as a really beautiful
performance. Slowly and steadily she would pursue
her imaginary foe; suddenly her step would quicken
as she came in sight of the enemy; she would dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
faster and faster, and, seizing an arrow, demonstrate
by the rapidity of her movements that the fight had
begun; she would point with the arrow, show how
it wings its course, how the scalp is taken, how the
victory is won.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Among the Winnebagoe Indians
also it was part of the war dance for a warrior to
go through the pantomime of the discovery of the
enemy, of the ambuscade, the attack, the slaughter,
and the scalping.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> And in this reference may be
noted the curious proceeding of the women of Accra,
on the Guinea Coast, who, whilst the male population
were engaged in war with a neighbouring people, endeavoured
every day to bring it to a happy issue by
dancing fetish; that is, by fighting sham battles with
wooden swords, flying to the boats on the beach and
pretending to row, throwing some one into the sea,
taking a trowel and making believe to build a wall—all
actions literally symbolical of corresponding ones
to be performed by the men in the course of defeating
their enemy.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In Madagascar, too, when the men are
absent in war, the custom of the women to dance, in
order to inspire their husbands with courage, has been
thought not to be destitute of a religious meaning.</p>

<p>That a dance may be in reality a form of prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a petition acted instead of spoken, as more likely so
to be understood, makes it possible that prayers may
be hidden under customs which are generally only
cited to illustrate the absurdity of primitive metaphysics.
May it not be that the Indian, when he
thinks to ensure a successful chase by drawing a figure
of his game with a line leading to its heart from its
mouth, and by so subjecting its movements to himself,
or when he thinks to cure a man of sickness by shooting
the bark-effigy of the animal supposed to possess
him—may it not be that he thereby hopes to influence
known or unknown natural forces in his favour by a
clear representation of his wants? The control of
natural phenomena by witchcraft may thus have been
in its origin a direction to natural phenomena, or
rather to the spirits ruling them; an address perhaps
to those spirits of the dead which to a savage are his
earliest and for long his only gods; and thus the
absurdities of fetishism might become intelligible as
lifeless prayers, with more or less of their primal
meaning, descended from such a philosophy of nature.
The Kamschadal child sent out naked to make the rain
stop, clear as the meaning of the custom is with the
prayer joined to it, would without it appear in the
light of ordinary fetishism. So the Khond, carrying
a branch cut from hostile soil to his god of war, and
there, after he has dressed it like one of the enemy,
throwing it down, with certain incantations, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
shrine of the divinity, urges his petition in a way which
even the god of war can scarcely fail to understand.
And the Basuto woman, who in her wish for children,
prays to her tutelary divinity for the accomplishment
of her desires by making dolls of clay and treating
them as infants, affords yet another illustration of the
operation of the same law of thought.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>It remains to show how, in primitive theology,
prayer attaches itself as well to the material as the
spiritual world, for it is here especially that it finds
its counterpart in the folk-lore of our own day. As,
however, there is scarcely an object in nature which
in a state of ignorance may not with reason be worshipped,
a few illustrations must be taken for thousands
on a subject it were less easy to exhaust than
the patience of the reader.</p>

<p>‘As for animals having reasoning powers,’ says
an exceptionally credible witness, ‘I have heard Indians
talk and reason with a horse the same as with
a person.’<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Our fairy tales of talking animals would
be commonplace facts to a savage. Hence it can be
no matter of surprise to find that it is a common
Indian custom to converse with rattlesnakes, and to
endeavour to propitiate them with presents of tobacco.
On one occasion, the Iowas having begun to build a
village, the presence of a rattlesnake on a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
hill was suddenly announced, when forthwith
started the great snake doctor with tobacco and other
presents: when he had offered these, and had had a
long talk with the snake, he returned to his village,
with the satisfactory news that his tribesmen might
now travel in safety, as peace had been made between
them and the snakes.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps of all natural objects that have
attracted human worship, and been regarded as a
supreme source of human woe or welfare, none can
compare with the moon. For the moon’s changes
of aspect being far more remarkable than any of the
sun’s, and more calculated to inspire dread by the
nocturnal darkness they contend with, are held in
popular fancy nearly everywhere to cause, portend, or
accord with changes in the lot of mortals and all
things terrestrial. In the Hervey Islands cocoa-nuts
are invariably planted at the full of the moon, the
size of the latter being held symbolical of the future
fulness of the fruit;<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and in South Africa it is unlucky
to begin a journey or any work of importance in the
last quarter of the moon.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The moon’s wane makes
things on earth wane too; when it is new or full, it is
everywhere the proper season for new crops to be
sown, new households to be formed, new weather to
begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The feeling of the Congo Africans, who at the
sight of the new moon fall on their knees or stand and
clap their hands, praying that their lives may be renewed
like that of the moon, corresponds exactly with
the idea of English folk-lore that crops are more
likely to be plentiful if sown when the moon is young,
or with the idea of German folk-lore that the new
moon is the season for counting money which it is
desired may increase. ‘On the first appearance of the
new moon, which,’ says Mungo Park, ‘the Kafirs look
upon as newly created, the pagan natives, as well as
Mahomedans, say a short prayer,’ seemingly the only
adoration they offer to the Supreme Being;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> so that the
sentiment of the Congo prayer may be guessed to underlie,
consciously or not, the salutations by which the
new moon is greeted generally throughout Africa, from
the salutations of the Hottentots to the prayers of
the Makololos, for the success of their journeys or
the destruction of their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>More difficult to understand than the worship of
either animals or the heavenly bodies is that of such
inanimate things as stones, trees, or rivers. Yet the
state of thought is not so far remote from our own but
that we can still listen with pleasure, in stories like
‘Undine,’ to the voices of the forest or the river. To
a savage, however, it is not only the motion or the
sound of natural objects which suggests their divinity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but the danger that is ever latent in them; and it is
rather to prevent the river from drowning him or the
tree from falling on him than from any perception of
their beauty that he makes offerings to them and
pays them homage. Such feelings as that of the Cree
Indians, who believed that a deer, found dead within
a few yards of a willow bush which they worshipped
and of which it had eaten, had fallen a victim to the
sin of its sacrilege, are not confined to savage lands
nor times.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> As savages have been known to apologize
to a slain elephant or bear, assuring it that its death was
accidental, so it is said that in parts of Germany a
woodcutter will still (or would recently) beg the pardon
of a fine healthy tree before cutting it down.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In our
own midland counties there is a feeling to this day
against binding up elder-wood with other faggots; and
in Suffolk it is believed misfortune will ensue if ever
it is burnt. In Germany formerly an elder-tree might
not be cut down entirely; and Grimm was himself an
eye-witness of a peasant praying with bare head and
folded hands before venturing to cut its branches.
That trees are still popularly endowed with a conscious
personality is further proved by the custom,
not yet extinct, of trying to secure the future favours
of fruit trees by presents and prayers. The placing
of money in a hole dug at the foot of them, the presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
them with money on New Year’s Day, the
shaking under them of the remainder of the Christmas
dinner, the beating of them with rods on Holy
Innocents’ Day—all German methods to incite fruit
trees to further fertility—answer closely to the English
custom of apple-howling or wassailing, when at
Christmas or Epiphany the inhabitants of a parish,
walking in procession to the principal orchards, and
there singling out the principal tree, sprinkle it with
cider, or place cider-soaked cakes of toast and sugar
in its branches, saluting it at the same time with set
words in the form of a prayer to the trees to be fruitful
for the ensuing year, as the doggerel verses following
show plainly enough:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Here’s to thee, old apple tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Whence thou mayst bud and whence thou mayst blow,</div>
<div class="verse">And whence thou mayst bear apples enow,</div>
<div class="verse">Hats full, caps full,</div>
<div class="verse">Bushel, bushel, sacks full,</div>
<div class="verse">And my pocket full too.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And similar prayers, as lifeless now as the fossil
shells on the shore of some ancient coral sea, lie
scattered abundantly in many an English rhyme and
ballad, serving to show how the philosophy of one age
passes into the nonsense of a later one, and how ideas
which constituted a religion for one time may only
survive as an amusement for another.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>SOME SAVAGE PROVERBS.</i></span></h2>

<p>The German proverb, ‘Speak, that I may see thee,’
may be applied as truly to a whole community as to
an individual. For proverbs—or, roughly defining,
popular sayings—reflect conspicuously the general
character of a nation, constituting its actual code of
social, political, and moral philosophy. Besides the
beauty and wisdom, from which alone many of them
derive an imperishable charm, they serve as a kind of
literature in miniature, in which the inner life of a
nation is more clearly legible than in its more voluminous
writings. And in spite of the general
resemblance which seems to pervade the proverbial
lore of the world, arising partly from the direct interchange
of thought inseparable from international
commerce of any kind, partly from a uniformity of
experience—such, for example, as has impressed on
all people the wisdom of caution and truth—there are
yet well-marked differences in the proverbs of nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
which as clearly retain the records of their several
histories as do their different laws and customs.
Remarkable, therefore, as is the substantial similarity
of proverbial codes, of which the general characteristic
is a high sense of right coupled with a mournful
consciousness of human infirmity, they betray often in
the very expression of the same idea the individuality
of their national birthplace. It is obvious, for instance,
that, largely as all modern nations are indebted to
a writer like Æsop for the thoughts they share in
common, each nation severally will owe more of its
wisdom to writers of its own, who, like Shakespeare
or Cervantes, have, from greater familiarity
with the manners, been more competent to express
the feelings, of their different countries. But the
way in which good proverbs, like good gold, find
acceptance everywhere, and pass readily into the
current coinage of different realms, may be illustrated
by the fact of the existence, in countries so widely
remote as Spain, Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, and
India, of a saying, second to none in all the essentials
of a good proverb, to the effect that ‘when God wills
the destruction of an ant, he supplies it with wings.’<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>An instructive instance of the light thrown on
national character by proverbs may be supplied from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a comparison of Italian, German, and Persian teaching
on the subject of vindictiveness. In communities
destitute of social organisation, the ‘vendetta,’ or duty
of blood-revenge, probably preceded and led the way
to the practice of legal punishment. Originally it was
a kind of lynch-law, supplying the default of any legal
protection of life; and all nations bear traces in their
history of having passed through a stage of growth in
which the sacred duty of vengeance was the germ of
any idea of a more judicial retribution. Confucius
made it a duty for a son to slay his father’s murderer,
just as Moses insisted on a strictly retaliatory penalty
for bloodshed. The duty of revenge, which if it is yet
extinct in Corsica survives with so much interest in
the play of ‘The Corsican Brothers,’ to this day, in
places like Fiji, still passes from father to son, and
from the son to the nearest relation. The longer
survival of such feelings in Italy, consequent on the
different circumstances of her history, is clearly impressed
on the proverbial philosophy of her people,
constituting a remarkable contrast to the sentiments
of other countries. For the Italian, extolling the
sweetness of revenge, declares it a morsel fit for God;
and, expressing pity or contempt for the man who
either cannot or will not carry out his revenge, counsels
patience and the waiting of time and place for its
successful execution. In a proverb so terribly expressive
that you seem to hear in it the assassin’s gnashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
teeth, he will tell you that ‘revenge, though a hundred
years old, still has its milk teeth,’ a maxim which stands
on no higher a level than the pagan African saying,
‘Hate hath no medicine,’ or than that of Afghanistan,
‘Speak good words to an enemy very softly, gradually
destroy him root and branch;’ and which may be fitly
compared with the Fijian expression of malice: ‘Let
the shell of the oyster perish by reason of years, and
to these add a thousand more, still my hatred shall
be hot.’ How much purer than the Italian is the
German teaching, which declares revenge to be fresh
wrong, the conversion of a little right into a great
injustice, and sure in its turn to draw revenge after it;
or how far nobler still is the more positive sentiment
of Persia, that to take revenge for an injury is the
sign of a mean spirit; that it is easy to return evil
for evil, but that the manly thing is to return good
for it!</p>

<p>The contrast conveyed in these proverbs is the
more striking, in that Italy might pre-eminently call
herself the Catholic, as against Germany the heretical,
or Persia the infidel, land. It has been said that
every tenth proverb in an Italian collection contains
a selfish or cynical maxim; and though the beauty
and purity of many Italian sayings counterbalance the
baseness of others—those, for instance, on love being
as refined as those on revenge are barbarous—it may
not be uninteresting to compare generally the proverbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of Italy with those of a land like Persia where the
religious history has been so different.</p>

<p>The noblest Italian proverb is to the effect that
a hundred years cannot repair a moment’s loss of
honour; the basest, perhaps, that bad as it is to be a
knave, it is worse to be known as one. To love a
friend with all his faults; to associate with the good
in order to be good; to work in order to rest; to do
right in spite of consequences, and good irrespectively
of persons; to do evil never, whatever the benefit—these
are among the highest lessons of Italian
proverb-lore. That among men of honour a word is
a bond, and that conscience is as good as a thousand
witnesses; that the best sermon is a good life, and
that the gains of begging are dearly bought, are
maxims of the same upright tendency. Yet, over
against these, are proverbs pervaded by the saddest
spirit of universal mistrust, instilling utter disbelief
of any sincerity in friendship, and even counselling to
selfish or downright wicked conduct. What more
melancholy evidence of this than is afforded by the
following common sayings?—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He who suspects is seldom to blame.</p>

<p>Trust was a good man, Trust-not a better.</p>

<p>From those I trust God guard me; from those I mistrust I will guard myself.</p>

<p>Who would have many friends let him test but few.</p>

<p>Tell your secret to your friend, and he will set his foot on your neck.</p>

</div>

<p>Or, again, what can be thought of such maxims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
as, that it is expedient to peel a fig for your friend
but a peach for your enemy; that the man who
esteems none but himself is happy as a king; that
public money, like holy water, is the property of all
men; or that with art and knavery men may live
through half the year, and with knavery and art
through the other?</p>

<p>The Persian proverbs seem to breathe a different
moral atmosphere from these, being as generous in
character as the Italian are cynical, and displaying a
free spirit of liberality, trust, independence, above all,
of truthfulness, which is unsurpassed in any country
of Europe. If in Italy it is common to say that a
man who cannot flatter knows not how to talk, in
Persia the sentiment prevails that to flatter is worse
than to abuse. The Persian, true to the character
given of him by Herodotus, holds boldly, that the
man who speaks truth is always at ease; that men
never suffer from speaking the truth; that it behoves
them to speak their minds unreservedly, for that
there is no hill in front of the tongue. Add to this
the popular sayings, that the accounts of friends are
in the heart, and that it is better to be in chains with
friends than in the garden with strangers. That it
should have become proverbial in Persia, that a man
lowers himself by vexing the poor, and loses all claim
to greatness by finding fault with his inferiors, proves
the purity of a religion which has instilled such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
thoughts into the ethics of a nation; nor could any
language in Europe produce proverbs characterised
by a higher spirit of morality than is revealed in the
following selection:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A high name is better than a high house.</p>

<p>The cure for anger is silence.</p>

<p>A man must cut out his own garments of reputation.</p>

<p>Heaven is at the feet of mothers (<i>i.e.</i> lies in dutiful obedience).</p>

<p>It is better to die of want than to beg.</p>

<p>The liberal man is the friend of God.</p>

<p>Practise liberality, but lay no stress on the obligation.</p>

</div>

<p>As another illustration of the way in which a
few proverbs may condense centuries of history, may
be instanced the recorded experiences of mankind
touching priests and priestcraft. With no other
evidence than that of proverbs before him, a future
historian of Europe might easily detect a marked
difference of feeling on this matter between Protestant
Germany and the Catholic countries of
Europe. Not that the latter are wanting in sayings
to the prejudice of the priestly class, but they are not
so numerous as in Germany. The French have two
proverbs, marked with all the wit and boldness of
their genius, one charging anyone who values a clean
house not to let into it either a priest or a pigeon;
the other declaring that it is human ignorance alone
which causes the pot to boil for priests. The Spanish
experience also is, that it is best neither to have a
good friar for a friend nor a bad one for an enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and that it is well to keep awake in a land thickly
tenanted by monks. But the Germans go much
farther than this. In German estimation the priest
is a being who, in company with a woman, may be
found at the bottom of all the mischief that goes on
in the world, and is as little likely as a woman to
forgive you an injury. Like the bites of wolves,
those of priests are hard to heal, so that it is best, if
you fight with them at all, to beat them to death. If
they are ever hot, it is from eating, not from work; for
they always take care to bless themselves first, nor
do they ever pay any tithes to one another.</p>

<p>The above comparisons suffice to show how differences
of national character, and even how the
operation of different forms of faith, may reveal
themselves in proverbs. Yet such estimates must
be formed with caution, in consideration of the wide
possibilities of error which are inseparable from so
inexhaustible a subject. For not only may the
proverb-collector easily attribute to one country
alone a saying which belongs equally to, or may even
have originated in, another, but his canon of selection
is somewhat arbitrary and dependent on his preconceptions
of what a proverb really is. ‘To take the
ball on the hop,’ for instance, is as genuine an English
proverb as ‘to make hay whilst the sun shines,’ which
contains the same idea; yet whilst the one might be
heard every day, the other might not be heard once a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
year, so that it might easily escape notice altogether,
or if found be rejected as obsolete. We can consequently,
as in other branches of human study, only
make use, <i>on trust</i>, of such data as lie at hand, and,
whilst fully acknowledging the imperfection of the
evidence, strive after an approximation to truth, without
hope for its actual attainment.</p>

<p>If now we extend the limits of our comparison, to
take in some proverbs of the lower races as well as of
the higher, we shall find therein a strong corroboration
of the lesson already learnt in any comparison
of the superstitions, myths, and manners of different
societies; namely, that differences of race, colour, and
even structure, sink into insignificance when compared
with the intellectual affinities which unite the families
of mankind, and that there is, perhaps, no phase of
thought nor shade of feeling belonging to the higher
culture of the world to which we may not find an antitype
or even an equivalent in the lower. If we take
some of the proverbs collected from tribes confessedly
low in civilisation—those, for instance, of West Africa—and
compare them with proverbs still prevalent in
Europe, we cannot fail to be struck with the strong
likeness between them, as well as impressed with the
idea, that many actually existent common sayings
may have had their birth in days of the most remote
and savage antiquity. The immense number of
modern proverbs, drawn from the observation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
natural, and especially of the animal, world (a number
which must be nearly one out of five), coupled
with the coincidence that the same fact is perhaps
the most striking one in the proverbs collected from
West Africa, seems to lend some support to such
a theory.</p>

<p>As an introductory instance let us take savage
and civilised sentiments about poverty, a belief in
the misfortune of which is written clearly in every
language of Europe. Italian experience says that
poverty has no kin, and that poor men do penance
for rich men’s sins; in Germany the poor have to
dance as the rich pipe; whilst in Spain and Denmark
the evil is expressed more graphically still, it being
a matter of observation in the one country that the
poor man’s crop is destroyed by hail every year; in
the other, that the poor man’s corn always grows thin.
And, in the Oji dialect, spoken by about two millions
of people, including the Ashantees, Fantees, and
others, it is also proverbial that the poor man has no
friend, that poverty makes a man a slave, and that
hard words are fit for the poor. And as the Dutch
have learnt, that ‘poor folks’ wisdom goes for little,’
or the Italians, that ‘the words of the poor go many
to the sackful,’ so in Oji exactly the same idea is
conveyed in the saying, that ‘when a poor man
makes a proverb it does not spread’; in Yoruba, in
the saying, that ‘poverty destroys a man’s reputation;’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and in Accra in the still cleverer proverb,
that ‘a poor man’s pipe does not sound.’<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The proverbs of savages are moral and immoral,
elevated and base, precisely as are those of more
civilised nations. The proverbs of the Yorubas, justly
observes the missionary, Mr. Bowen,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> ‘are among the
most remarkable of the world;’ and indeed the intellectual
powers and moral ideas displayed in West
African proverbs generally ought largely to modify
our conceptions of their originators, and make us
sceptical of that extreme dearth of mental wealth
which has so frequently been declared to attend a low
standard of material advancement. Their wit, terseness,
vividness of illustration, and insight into life, are
all alike surprising; and acquaintance with them
must suggest caution in any estimate of the mental
capacities of savages whose languages may have
been less investigated and consequently remain less
known. ‘It has always been passing travellers who
have drawn the most doleful pictures of so-called
savages, and especially have asserted the poverty of
their language.’<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It may well prove that better acquaintance
with the languages of tribes, classed at
present for various reasons almost outside the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
family, may show them to combine, as Humboldt
found was the case with the once depreciated Carib
language, ‘wealth, grace, strength, and gentleness.’
It was said of the Veddahs once that they were
utterly destitute of either religion or <i>language</i>; and
the Samojeds were reported to shriek and chatter like
apes.</p>

<p>The Basutos of South Africa are savages, yet the
following proverbs are current among them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A good name makes one sleep well.</p>

<p>Stolen goods do not make one grow.</p>

<p>Famine dwells in the house of the quarrelsome.</p>

<p>The thief catches himself.</p>

<p>A lent knife does not come back alone.
(<i>i.e.</i> a good deed is never thrown away.)<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Compare, for elevation of mind, these Yoruban
proverbs with those already noticed as current in
Italy:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He that forgives gains the victory.</p>

<p>He who injures another injures himself.</p>

<p>Anger benefits no one.</p>

<p>We should not treat others with contempt.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, ‘If a great man should wrong
you, smile on him,’ may be compared with the Arabic
advice about dangerous friends, ‘If a serpent love
thee, wear him as a necklace;’ or with the Pashto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
proverb of the same intention, ‘Though your enemy
be a rope of reeds, call him a serpent.’</p>

<p>Here are some more proverbs with whose European
equivalents everyone will be familiar:—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On Faultfinding.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If you can pull out, pull out your own grey hairs. (Oji.)</p>

<p>Before healing others, heal yourself. (Wolof.)</p>

</div>

<p>With which we may compare the Chinese:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sweep the snow from your own doors without troubling about
the frost on your neighbour’s tiles.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On the Value of Experience.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Nobody is twice a fool. (Accra.)</p>

<p>Nobody is twice ashamed. (Accra.)</p>

<p>He is a fool whose sheep run away twice. (Oji.)</p>

<p>He dreads a slowworm who has been bitten by a serpent. (Oji.)</p>

</div>

<p>With which we may compare our own—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It’s a silly fish that’s caught twice with the same bait.</p>

</div>

<p>Or the German—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>An old fox is not caught twice in the same trap.</p>

</div>

<p>To which both Italy and Holland have exactly similar
proverbs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On Perseverance.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Perseverance always triumphs. (Basuto.)</p>

<p>The moon does not grow full in a day. (Oji.)</p>

<p>Perseverance is everything.</p>

<p>Who has patience has all things. (Yoruba.)</p>

<p>By going and coming a bird builds its nest. (Oji.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Which latter may be compared with the Dutch
proverb—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By slow degrees a bird builds its nest.</p>

</div>

<p>And all of them with the Chinese—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A mulberry-leaf becomes satin with time.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On the Force of Habit.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The thread follows the needle.</p>

<p>Its shell follows the snail wherever it goes. (Yoruba.)</p>

<p>As is the sword so is the scabbard. (Oji.)</p>

</div>

<p>To which again China supplies a good parallel in</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The growth of the mulberry tree follows its early bent.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On Causation.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If nothing touches the palm-leaves they do not rustle. (Oji.)</p>

<p>Nobody hates another without a cause. (Accra.)</p>

<p>A feather does not stick without gum. (A Pashto proverb.)</p>

</div>

<p>Again, the Turkish proverb, that curses, like
chickens, come home to roost, or the Italian one that,
like processions, they come back to their starting-point,
is well matched by the Yoruba proverb that ‘ashes
fly back in the face of their thrower.’ Or the tendency
of travellers to exaggerate or tell lies, impressed as it
has been on all human experience, is also confirmed
by the Oji proverb, that ‘he who travels alone tells
lies.’ And the universal belief in the ultimate exposure
of falsehood conveyed in such proverbs as
the Arabian, ‘The liar is short-lived;’ the Persian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
‘Liars have bad memories;’ or the still more expressive
Italian saying, that ‘the liar is sooner caught than a
cripple,’ finds itself corroborated by the Wolof proverb,
that ‘lies, though many, will be caught by Truth as
soon as she rises up.’ Even in Afghanistan, where it
is said that no disgrace attaches to lying <i>per se</i>, and
where lying is called an honest man’s wings, while
truth can only be spoken by a strong man or a fool,
there is also a proverb with the moral, that the career
of falsehood is short.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>That ‘hope is the pillar of the world,’ that ‘it is
the heart which carries one to hell or heaven,’ or that
‘preparation is better than after-thought’—all experiences
of the Kanuri, a Moslem tribe, who think it a
personal adornment to cut each side of their face in
twenty places—shows that there is no necessary connection
between general savagery and an absence of
moral culture. The natives of New Zealand, with all
their barbarity, had in common use a saying which
were a desirable maxim for European diplomacy:
‘When you are on friendly terms, settle your disputes
in a friendly way; when you are at war, redress your
injuries by violence.’<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Even the Fijians would say
that an unimproved day was not to be counted, and
that no food was ever cooked by gay clothes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
frivolity.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> A good Ashantee proverb warns people
not to speak ill of their benefactors, by forbidding
them to call a forest a shrubbery that has once given
them shelter. The proverbs already quoted from Yoruba
teach the same lesson, nor would it be difficult
to add many more, all proving the existence among
savages of a morality identical in its main features
with that of the higher group of nations to which we
ourselves belong, interpenetrated as it has been for ages
with the philosophies and religions of the civilised
East.</p>

<p>A similar testimony to the intellectual powers
of savages is afforded by their proverbs, though of
course the argument is only a suggestive one from
tribes whose language has been well studied to others
not so well known. That the Soudan negroes are on
a higher level of general culture than many savages
of other islands or continents is proved by the fact
that all known Africans are acquainted with the art
of smelting iron and converting it into weapons and
utensils; so that they may be said to be living in
the iron age, and thus, materially at least, are more
advanced than the Botocudos of Brazil, who are still
in the age of polished stone implements. From the
fact alone that the Yorubas express their contempt
for a stupid man by saying that he cannot count nine
times nine, we are enabled at once to place them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
above tribes whose powers of numeration fall short of
such readiness. Hence we should not be justified in
expecting to find among Australian or American
aborigines proverbs of so high an intellectual order
as abound in Africa, of which the following may
be selected as samples:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Were no elephant in the jungle the buffalo would be large;</p>

</div>

<p>or—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The dust of the buffalo is lost in that of the elephant.</p>

<p>A crab does not bring forth a bird.</p>

<p>Two small antelopes beat a big one.</p>

<p>Two crocodiles do not live in one hole.</p>

<p>A child can crush a snail, but not a tortoise.</p>

<p>A razor cannot shave itself.</p>

<p>You cannot stop the sun by standing before it.</p>

<p>If you like honey, do not fear the bees.</p>

<p>When a fish is killed its tail is inserted in its own mouth.
(Said of people who reap the reward of their deeds.)</p>

</div>

<p>The Zulus, speaking of the uncertainty of a result, say,
‘It is not known what calf the cow will have;’<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and
when the Fantees tell you to ‘cross the river before you
abuse the crocodile,’<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> there is no difficulty in translating
their meaning into English. In all these
proverbs it is obvious how the facts of every-day life
have readily served everywhere as the basis of intellectual
advancement, and how similar lessons have
everywhere been drawn from the observation of
similar occurrences.</p>

<p>Leaving now the analogy between African and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
European proverb-lore, which the uniformity of moral
experiences and the observation of similar laws of
nature sufficiently account for, let us endeavour to find
among civilised nations any proverbs which, by the
figures involved in them or their likeness to savage
maxims, seem to bear a distinct impression of a
barbaric coinage. One French proverb may almost
certainly be so explained. It is, for instance, well
known that the lower races very generally account for
eclipses of either sun or moon by supposing them
to be the victims of the fury or voracity of some ill-disposed
animal, whom they try to divert by every
horrible noise they can produce, or by any weapon
they have learnt to fashion. A typical instance of
this was the belief of the Chiquitos of South America
that the moon was hunted across the sky by dogs,
who tore her in pieces when they caught her, till
driven off by the Indian arrows. It has been suggested
that the French proverb, ‘Dieu garde la lune
des loups,’ said in deprecation of a dread of remote
danger, is a survival of a similar rude philosophy of
nature which is still prevalent in the capital of Turkey,
and in the days of St. Augustine was current over
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Another instructive set of proverbs may be adduced
to show how the social philosophy current in
the savage state may survive in contemporary expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of modern Europe. In Africa, where, speaking
generally, a man’s wife has no better status in society
than that which attaches to his slave or his ox, and
a son has been known to wager his own mother
against a cow, we cannot be astonished at finding in
vogue proverbs strongly depreciatory of the worth of
the female sex. Thus a wise Kanuri is cautioned,
that if a woman shall speak to him two words, he
shall take one and leave the other; nor should he
give his heart to a woman, if he would live, for a
woman never brings a man into the right way. So,
too, Pashto proverbs say contemptuously, that a
woman’s wisdom is under her heel, and that she is
well only in the house or in the grave. The same
feeling is endorsed by the Persians, who declare that
both women and dragons are best out of the world,
classing the former with horses and swords among
their by-words of unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>The literatures of all countries are strongly tinged
with sentiments of the same unjust nature. Even the
French say that a man of straw is worth a woman of
gold, though their proverb, ‘Ce que femme veut, Dieu
le veut,’ is as true as it is a witty variation of the well-known
democratic formula. The Italians have made
the shrewd observation, that, whilst with men every
mortal sin is venial, with women every venial sin is
mortal; but no language has anything worse than
this, that as both a good horse and a bad horse need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the spur, so both a good woman and a bad woman
need the stick.</p>

<p>It is, however, in Germany that the character of
women has suffered most from the shafts of that other
half of the community, which (it might be complained)
has as unfair a monopoly of making proverbs as it
has of making laws. The humorous saying, that there
are only two good women in the world, one of whom
is dead and the other not to be found, contains the
key to the common national sentiment. A woman is
compared to good fortune in her partiality for fools, and
to wine in her power to make them. Like a glass, she is
in hourly danger; and, like a priest, she never forgets.
Her vengeance is boundless, and her mutability finds its
only parallel in nature in the uncertain skies of April.
Her affections change every moment, like luck at
cards, the favour of princes, or the leaves of a rose;
and though you will never find her wanting in words,
there is not a needle-point’s difference betwixt her
yea and her nay. She only keeps silence where she
is ignorant, and it is as fruitless to try to hold a woman
at her word as an eel by its tail. Her advice, like corn
sown in summer, may perhaps turn out well once in
seven years; but wherever there is mischief brewing
in the world, rest assured that there is a woman and
a priest at the bottom of it. Every daughter of Eve
would rather be beautiful than good, and may be
caught as surely by gold as a hare by dogs or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
gentleman by flattery. Even in the house she should
be allowed no power, for where a woman rules the
devil is chief servant; whilst two women in the same
house will agree together like two cats over a mouse
or two dogs over a bone.</p>

<p>Spanish experience on this subject coincides with
the Teutonic, but without the expenditure of nearly so
much spleen, and with several glimpses of a happier
experience. What can be worse than this: ‘Beware
of a bad woman, nor put any trust in a good one;’ or
sadder than this: ‘What is marriage, mother? Spinning,
childbirth, and crying, daughter’? Yet the
Spanish woman, as hard to know as a melon, as little
to be trusted as a magpie, as fickle as the wind or as
fortune, as ready to cry as a dog to limp, in labour as
patient as a mule, is not so destitute as the German
of any redeeming qualities for her failings. The
Spaniard is taught to believe that with a good wife he
may bear any adversity, and that he should believe
nothing against her unless absolutely proved. It is
also in remarkable contrast to the experiences of
other countries, that in Spain it should have passed into
a proverb, that whilst an unmarried man advocates
a daily beating for a wife, as soon as he marries he
takes care of his own.</p>

<p>Female talkativeness appears also to be a subject
of lament all over the world, from our own island, where
a woman’s tongue proverbially wags like a lamb’s tail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to the Celestial Empire, where it is likened to a sword,
never suffered by its owner to rust. Regard not a
woman’s words, says the Hindoo; and the African
also is warned against trusting his secrets even to
his wife. The Spaniard believes that he has only to
tell a woman what he would wish to have published
in the market-place; and all languages have sayings
to the same effect. The Scotch divine who, before the
Session, defended his heresy that women would find no
place in heaven, by the text, ‘There was silence in heaven
for about the space of half an hour,’ only expressed
a sentiment of universal currency over the world.</p>

<p>The proverbs collected from the lower races are
still very few, when compared with the immense mass
of those from nations with whose literature we are
more familiar. It is in the nature of things that
missionaries and travellers should have been first
struck by, and first given us information about,
matters more directly challenging their notice than
phrases in common use, for a real knowledge of which
the most favourable conditions of a prolonged intimacy
are obviously requisite. The large collection of such
proverbs from West Africa alone, revealing as they
do an elevation of feeling and a clearness of intelligence
which other facts of their social life would
never have led us to suspect, point at the possibility
of such collections elsewhere largely modifying
our present views concerning other savage tribes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
They at least should teach us caution against accepting
the conclusions which some writers have drawn from
their study of savage languages, when, from the absence
or loss in a dialect of such words as ‘love’ or ‘gratitude,’
they proceed to explain, on the hypothesis of degradation,
that rude state of existence which is denoted
by the word ‘savage,’ and which there are abundant
reasons for supposing was really the primitive germ,
out of which all subsequent civilisation has been unfolded.
‘Were,’ says Archbishop Trench, ‘the savage
the primitive man, we should then find savage tribes
furnished, scantily enough it might be, with the elements
of speech, yet, at the same time, with its fruitful
beginnings, its vigorous and healthful germs. But
what does their language on close inspection prove?
In every case what they are themselves, the remnant
and ruin of a better and a nobler past. Fearful indeed
is the impress of degradation which is stamped on the
language of the savage—more fearful, perhaps, even
than that which is stamped upon his form.’<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Yet,
whatever may be the case with some tribes, who may
be shown historically to have fallen from a higher state
(and such are the exceptions), at least the languages
spoken in Africa bear no such ‘fearful impress of degradation’
as are declared to be traceable <i>in every case</i>,
if we may judge of a language by the thoughts which it
expresses rather than by the words which it contains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>SAVAGE MORAL PHILOSOPHY.</i></span></h2>

<p>Lucretius, in his retrospect of prehistoric times,
imagines primeval man as unpossessed of any moral
law, and is at pains to explain how, as men were once
ignorant of the property of either fire to warm or of
skins to cover them, so once there was a time when
no moral restraints affected the relations between
man and man.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Across the Atlantic we find the same
strain of thought in the myths, common in many
different stages of progress, of those culture heroes
who had come long ago to teach men the arts and
virtues of life, and had left their names to be worshipped
by a grateful posterity. The Peruvian legend,
that moral law was unknown until the Sun
sent two of his children to raise humanity from their
animal condition, coincides with the modern hypothesis
that the morality of the cave-men resembled very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
much that of the cave-bear; so that it becomes a
subject worthy of inquiry whether any human communities
ever have lived, or are actually living, with
no more idea of moral right and wrong than is
necessary for the social harmony of a wolf-pack or a
wasp’s nest; whether, in short, what to the Roman was
a matter of speculation, or to the American of legend,
can fairly become for us one of science.</p>

<p>The Shoshones of North America, some of whom
are said to have built absolutely no dwellings, but to
have lived in caves and among the rocks, or burrowed
like reptiles in the ground; or the Cochinis, who
resorted at night for shelter to caverns and holes in
the ground, may be taken as the best representatives
of the ancient cave-dwellers, and the nearest known
approach to communities living in the state presupposed
by the legends of most latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Californians
generally are said to have had ‘no morals,
nor any religion worth calling such;’ yet even the
Shoshones knew, like so many other American tribes,
how to ratify either a treaty or a bargain by the
ceremony of smoking, and used shell-money as an
instrument of barter. But some moral notions must
enter into the rudest kind of barter, and barter was
known to the ancient cave-dwellers of Périgord, just
as it is to the lowest contemporary savage tribes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Rock crystal and Atlantic shells, found among the
remains of men, tigers, and bears, in the caves of
Périgord, could, it is argued, only have got thither by
barter; so that the earliest human beings we have
record of must have possessed at least so much
morality as is necessary for commerce.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>As regards existing savages, evidence as to their
moral ideas can only be sought in incidental allusion
to their customs, penalties, beliefs, or myths, never
in chapters expressly devoted to the delineation of
their moral character. Not only do such delineations
by different writers conflict hopelessly with one another,
but inconsistencies abound in the accounts of the same
writer, as, for instance, where Cranz describes Greenlanders
as mild and peaceable, and a few pages further
on as ‘naturally of a murderous disposition.’ The
value of Cranz’ evidence is marred by the fact that
he writes expressly to rebut the Deistic idea of a
natural morality existing by the light of reason and
independent of Revelation; and the evidence of other
writers, whenever a long residence among savages
entitles them to speak with any authority at all, is
spoilt by their several temptations to bias. Whether
the temptation be to enliven a book of travel, to inculcate
the need and enhance the merit of missionary
labours, or to illustrate the uniformity of moral perceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and the universality of certain moral laws, in
any case we are exposed to the error of mistaking for
habitual what is really peculiar, and of misunderstanding
the indications of facts which are as often
anomalous as they are illustrative.</p>

<p>The way, also, in which the love of theory may
give rise to unjustifiable credulity or even to absolute
misstatement may be exemplified from the common
story of the Bushman who spoke with absolute unconcern
of having murdered his brother, or of the
other Bushman who gave as an instance of his idea of
a good action, stealing some one else’s wife, and of a
bad one, losing in the same way his own. According
to the original authority, the Bushmen who were
questioned, to test their intelligence, on a few moral
points, and especially on what they considered good
actions and what bad, belonged to a kraal of extremely
poor, half-starved Bushmen, seemingly ‘the outcasts of
the Bushmen race;’ the interpreter, through whom
Burchell made his inquiries, said he could not make
them understand what he said, and to the specific
question about good and bad actions <i>they made no reply</i>,
the missionary himself adding, as comment, that ‘their
not understanding it must have been either pretended
stupidity or a wilful misrepresentation by the interpreter.’
This same interpreter is suspected by Burchell,
in the very same page, of such misrepresentation,
or of actual invention in respect of the story of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
murder—a story which, if true, adds the missionary,
would have justified him in saying, Here are men who
know not right from wrong. Yet both these stories
have been quoted to exemplify the state of the moral
destitution of the lower races.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The fear of incurring the ill-will of his fellow-beings
or of those invisible spirits disposed more or
less hostilely towards him and everywhere surrounding
him, must have sufficed, even for prehistoric man,
to have marked out certain acts as less advisable than
others, and so far as wrong. The instinct to repel or
revenge personal injuries, and the instinct to appease
the unknown forces of nature, neither of which, be it
assumed, acted less energetically in the past than the
present, must have always contributed to rank certain
sets of actions as better to be avoided. Personal or
tribal well-being has probably always supplied a
sufficiently defined moral standard, sufficiently defended
by real or fanciful sanctions. So suggests
theory; and in point of fact a savage tribe is as
difficult to find as it is to imagine, without a sense of
a difference in the quality of actions, arising from a
difference in their likely consequences to themselves.</p>

<p>The fear of revenge from a man’s survivors or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from his ghost would at any time tend to make
homicide a prominent act of guilt. The vendetta,
sometimes carried out as much against a homicidal
tiger or tree as against a man, would scarcely ever be
not dreaded by a human murderer; and the associations
are obvious and few between homicide as merely
an act to be avenged and a crime to be avoided.
Even in instances where bloodshed seems to have
left but an external stain, affecting the hands not the
heart of the murderer, and calling simply for purification
by washing, the presence of a feeling of difference
may be detected between the killing of a man
and the killing of a bear. But the dread of vengeance
from a murdered man’s ghost, which is said to have
acted as a check on murder among the Sioux Indians,
or the dread of such vengeance from the tutelary gods
of the deceased, which is said to have acted as a check
on cannibalism in Samoa, points to the existence of
prudential restraints which are likely not to have
been limited in their operation to a tribe in America
nor to an island in the Pacific.</p>

<p>But, besides spiritual terrors, secular punishment
has a well-defined place among savages, to check
the extreme indulgence of hatred or passion. It is
doubtful whether any savage tribe is so indifferent
to the criminality of murder as to be destitute of
customary penal laws to prevent or punish it. These
customs vary from the payment of a slight compensation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
payable either to the dead man’s family or to
the tribal chief, down to actual capital punishment.
Among the Northern Californians a few strings of
shell-money compounded for the murder of a man,
and half a man’s price was paid for a woman;
banishment from the tribe being sometimes the
penalty, death never.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Among the Kutchin tribes
human life was valued at forty beaver skins.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Even the
Veddahs insist upon compensation to survivors. The
Tunguse Lapps, with whom homicide was a brave
rather than a shameful act, punished nevertheless a
murderer with blows, and compelled him to support
the dead man’s relations.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> In some cases a slight
penance was the only law against homicide. A
Yuma Indian, for instance, who killed a tribesman
had perforce to starve for a month on vegetables and
water, bathing frequently during the day; whilst a
Pima who killed an Apache had to fast for sixteen
days, living in the woods, careful meanwhile to keep
his eyes from the sight of a blazing fire and his
tongue from conversation.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The custom, moreover, of extending to a whole
family the guilt of an individual is an additional
protection to human life among savages. In the
same way as, till lately, English law avenged itself
on the suicide who had escaped its jurisdiction, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
punishing the criminal’s relations, savage custom
satisfies indignation by taking any member of a
family as a substitute for a fugitive criminal. The
Thlinkeet Indians, if they cannot kill the actual
murderer, kill one of his tribe or family instead.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
‘An Indian,’ says Kane, ‘in taking revenge for the
death of a relative, does not, in all cases, seek the
actual offender; as, should the party be one of his
own tribe, any relative will do, however distant.’<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Catlin tells the story how, when a great Sioux
warrior, the Little Bear, had been shot by the Dog,
the avengers of the former, failing to overtake the
Dog, caught and slew his brother instead, notwithstanding
that he was a man much esteemed by the
tribe.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> If a Californian criminal escaped to a sacred
refuge he was regarded as a coward, in that he
diverted to a relation a punishment he deserved himself.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
In Samoa not only the murderer but all his
belongings would fly to another village as a city of
refuge, for in Samoan law a plaintiff might seek
redress from ‘the brother, son, or other relative of the
guilty party.’<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In Australia wide-spread consternation
followed the commission of a crime, especially if the
culprit escaped, for the brothers of the criminal held
themselves quite as guilty as he was, and only persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
unconnected with the family believed themselves safe.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
In the Fiji Islands a warrior once left his musket in
such a position that it went off and killed two persons.
The owner of the musket was condemned to death;
but, as he fled away, the strangulation of his father
instead of him perfectly satisfied the ends of justice.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The Samoans, as far back as it was possible to
trace, had had customary laws for the prevention of
theft, adultery, assault, and murder, and the penalties
for such crimes appeared rather to have grown milder
than severer with time. Not only this, but they had
penal customs for such wrong acts as rude conduct to
strangers, pulling down of fences, spoiling fruit trees,
or calling chiefs by opprobrious epithets. It is open
to doubt whether other savage tribes had not equally
good safeguards for preventing at least those greater
social offences, whose immorality furnishes the first
principle of even the ethics of civilised communities.</p>

<p>In Fiji the criminality of actions is said to have
varied with the social rank of the offender, murder
by a chief being accounted less heinous than a petty
larceny by a man of low rank. Theft, adultery, witchcraft,
violation of a <i>tabu</i>, arson, treason, and disrespect
to a chief were among the few crimes regarded as
serious. With regard to murder, we are told (and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
passage is a favourite one for illustrating the extreme
variability of moral sentiment), that to a Fijian shedding
of blood was ‘no crime, but a glory,’ and that
to be an acknowledged murderer was ‘the object
of his restless ambition.’ In a similar strain it has
been said, that in New Zealand intentional murder
was either very meritorious or of no consequence;
the latter if the victim were a slave, the former if he
belonged to another tribe. The malicious destruction
of a man of the same tribe was, however, rare, the
<i>lex talionis</i> alone applying to or checking it;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and it
is probable that this reservation in favour of native
New Zealand should be made for all cases where
murder is spoken of as a trivial matter. Whenever
murder is spoken of as no crime, reference seems
generally made to murder outside the tribe, so that
from the circumstances of savage life it resolves itself
into an act of ordinary hostility; or if the reference is
to murder within the tribe, it is to murder sanctioned
by necessity, custom, or superstition. The Carrier
Indians, who did not think murders worth confessing
when they confessed other crimes of their lives, yet
regarded the <i>murder of a fellow-tribesman as something
quite senseless</i>, and the man who committed such a
deed had to absent himself till he could pay the relatives,
since at home he was only safe if a chief lent him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
refuge of his tent or of one of his garments.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> ‘A
murder,’ says Sproat, ‘<i>if not perpetrated on one of his
own tribe</i>, or on a particular friend, is no more to an
Indian than the killing of a dog.’ The sutteeism and
parenticide, which missionaries describe as murders,
are, from the savage point of view, rather acts of
mercy, being intimately connected with their ideas of
future existence, to which it is neither fair nor scientific
to apply the phraseology and associations of
Christian morality.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Different tribes have evolved different institutions
for the prevention of wrongs, which supplement to a
large extent the absence of fixed legal remedies.</p>

<p>In Greenland there was the singing combat, in
which anyone aggrieved, dancing to the beat of a
drum and accompanied by his partisans, recited at
a public meeting a satirical poem, telling ludicrous
stories of his adversary, and obliged to listen afterwards
to similar abuse of himself, till, after a long
succession of charges and retorts, the assembled spectators
gave the victory to one of the combatants.
These combats, says Cranz, served to remind debtors
of the duty of repayment, to brand falsehood and
detraction with infamy, to punish fraud and injustice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and above all to overwhelm adultery with contempt.
The fear of incurring public disgrace at these combats
was, with the fear of retaliation for injury, the only
motive to virtue which the writer allows to the natives
of Greenland.</p>

<p>In Samoa thieves could be scared from plantations
by cocoa-nut leaflets so plaited as to convey an
imprecation; and a man who saw an artificial sea-pike
suspended from a tree would fear, that, if he
accomplished his theft, the next time he went fishing
a real sea-pike would dart up and wound him mortally.
Images of a similar nature, conveying imprecations of
disease, death, lightning, or a plague of rats, seem
also to have been effective restraints upon thievish
propensities;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and in the Tonga Islands fruits and
flowers were tabooed, that is, preserved, by plaited
representations of a lizard or a shark.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It is likely
that a similar meaning attached in Africa to certain
branches of trees which, stuck into the ground in a
particular manner, with bits of broken pottery, were
enough to prevent the most determined robber from
crossing a threshold.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Similar <i>tabu</i> marks were seen
on some rocks at Tahiti, placed there to prevent
people fishing or getting shells from the Queen’s preserves;<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
and it is possible that the origin of all <i>tabu</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
customs may have lain in the supposed efficacy of
symbolical imprecation.</p>

<p>In New Zealand the institution of <i>muru</i>, or the
legalized enforcement of damages by plunder, extended
the idea of sinfulness even to involuntary
wrongs or accidental sufferings. Involuntary homicide
is said to have involved more serious consequences
than murder of malice prepense; and if a man’s
child fell into the fire, or his canoe was upset and
himself nearly drowned, he was not only cudgelled
and robbed, but he would have deemed it a personal
slight not to have been so treated.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> To escape from
drowning was indeed a common sin in savage life, for
was it not to escape the just wrath of the Water Spirit,
and perhaps to turn it upon some one else? In
Kamschatka so heinous was the sin of cheating the
Water Spirit of his prey, by escape from drowning,
that no one would receive such a sinner into his house,
speak to him, nor give him food: he became, in short,
socially dead. Fijians who escape shipwreck are supposed
to be saved in order to be eaten, and Williams
tells, how on one occasion fourteen of them who lost
their canoe at sea only escaped becoming food for
sharks to become food for their friends on shore. If the
Koossa Kafirs see a person drowning, or indeed in any
danger of his life, they either run away from the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
or pelt the victim with stones as he dies.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> So also
with death by fire: if an Indian falls into the fire or
is partially burnt, it is believed that the spirits of his
ancestors pushed him into the flames owing to his
negligence in supplying them with food.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The
custom of an African tribe to expel from their community
anyone bitten by a zebra or an alligator, or
even so much as splashed by the tail of the latter, is
evidently related to the same idea.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Again, however much Catlin’s assertion that self-denial,
torture, and immolation were constant modes
among North American Indians for appealing to the
Great Spirit for countenance and forgiveness, may
overstate the truth, it is remarkable that not only
penance by fasting and self-torture, but the practice
of confession, should occur in the lower culture as a
mode of moral purification. Confession was common
not only in Mexico and Peru, but among widely remote
savage tribes, being closely connected with the belief
in the power of sin to cause, and of priestcraft to cure,
dangerous sickness. The Carrier Indians of North
America thought, that the only chance of recovery
from sickness lay in a disclosure before a priest of
every secret crime committed in life, and that the concealment
of a single fact would meet with the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of instantaneous death.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The Samoan Islanders
believing that all disease was due to the wrath of
some deity, would inquire of the village priest the
cause of sickness, who would sometimes in such cases
command the family to assemble and confess. At
this confessional ceremony each member of the family
would confess his crimes, and any judgments he might
have invoked in anger on the family or the invalid
himself; long-concealed crimes being often thus
disclosed.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In Yucatan, confession, introduced by
Cukulcan, the mythical author of their culture, was
much resorted to, ‘as death and disease were thought
to be direct punishments for sins committed.’ The
natives of Cerquin, in Honduras, confessed, not only
in sickness, but in immediate danger of any kind, or
to procure divine blessings on any important occasion.
So far did they carry it, that, if a travelling party
met a jaguar or puma, each would commend himself
to the gods, confessing loudly his sins, and imploring
pardon; if the beast still advanced they would cry
out, ‘We have committed as many more sins; do not
kill us.’<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>But over and above the wrong acts from which restraints
lie in the revenge of individuals, in punishment
by the community, or in artificial restrictions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
there is a large class of acts, defended rather by spiritual
than secular sanctions, deriving their sinfulness
from pure misconceptions of things, and constituting
for savages by far the larger part of their field for
right and wrong. The consciousness of having
trodden in the footstep of a bear would be as
painful to a Kamschadal as the consciousness of
having stolen, the possible consequences of the former
being infinitely more dreadful. Such acts as
the experience of primitive times has thus generalized
into acts provocative of unpleasant expressions
of dissatisfaction from the spiritual world, and
so far as sinful, become in the folk-lore of later
date acts merely unlucky or ominous. The feeling
to this day prevalent in parts of England and Germany,
that if you transplant parsley you may cause
its guardian spirit to punish you or your relations
with death, fairly illustrates how the wrongful acts
of bygone times may even in civilised countries continue
to be guarded by the very same sanction that
gave them potency in the days of savagery.</p>

<p>Of such regulations in restraint of the natural
liberty of savage tribes let it suffice to give some instances
of sinful acts which derive all their associations
of wrong from rude notions concerning the
nature of storms, of ancestors, of names, and of
animals. It will be seen that in some cases such
superstitions act as real checks to real wickedness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
though the connection between them seems purely
accidental, rather than the result of any intuitive discrimination
of the qualities of actions.</p>

<p>As English sailors will refrain from whistling at
sea, lest they should provoke a storm, so the Kamschadals
account many actions sinful on account of
their storm-breeding qualities. For this reason they
will never cut snow from off their shoes with a knife
out of doors, nor go barefooted outside their huts in
winter, nor sharpen an axe or a knife on a journey.
The Fuejian natives brought away by Captain
Fitzroy felt sure that anything wrong said or done
caused bad weather, especially the sin of shooting
young ducks. They declared their belief in an
omniscient Big Black Man, who had his living among
the woods and mountains, and influenced the weather
according to men’s conduct; in illustration of which
they told a story of a murderer, who ascribed to the
anger of this being a storm of wind and snow which
followed his crime.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In Vancouver’s Island there
is a mountain, the sin of mentioning which in passing
may cause a storm to overturn the offender’s
canoe.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Prominent among the moral checks of savage life
is the fear of the anger of the dead. Among savages
the supposed wishes of their departed friends, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
deified forefathers, operate as real commands, girt
with all the sanction of superstitious terror, and clothing
the most fanciful customs with all the obligatory
feelings of morality. A New Zealand chief, for instance,
would expect his dead ancestors to visit him
with disease or other calamity if he let food touch
any part of his body, or if he entered a dwelling where
food hung from the ceiling.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The wide prevalence of
the feeling that disease and death are due to the displeasure
of the dead, who may return to earth, to
reside in some part of a living person’s body, may be
illustrated by the Samoan custom of taking valuable
presents as a last expression of regard to the dying, or
by way of bribing them to forego their incorporeal
privilege of post-mortem revenge.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> On the Gold
Coast also friends make presents to the dead of gold,
brandy, or cloth, to be buried with them; just as in
ancient Mexico all classes of the population would beg
of their dead king to accept their offerings of food,
robes, or slaves, which they vied in giving him, or as
the Mayas would place precious gifts or ornaments
near or upon the corpse of a deceased lord of a province.
So the Bodos, presenting food at the graves
of their relations, would pray, saying, ‘Take and
eat ... we come no more to you, come no more to
us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Proper behaviour with regard to names is one of
the most important points of savage decorum. The
confusion, amounting almost to identification, between
a person and his name is one of the most signal proofs
of the power of language over thought. As Catlin’s
or Kane’s Indian pictures were thought to detract
from the originals something of their existence, giving
the painter such power over them that whilst living
their bodies would sympathise with every injury done
to their pictures, and when dead would not rest in
their graves, so the feeling among savages is strong
that the knowledge of a person’s name gives to
another a fatal control over his destiny. An Indian
once asked Kane ‘whether his wish to know his
name proceeded from a desire to steal it;’<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> whilst
with the Abipones it was positively sinful for anyone
to pronounce his own name. Kane could only discover
Indians’ names through third parties; and it is
curious that the natives of one of the Fiji Islands will
never tell their names to an inquirer, if there should
be anyone else to answer the question.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Hence it is
that the highest compliment a savage can pay a
person is to exchange names with him, a custom
which Cook found prevalent at Tahiti and in the
Society Islands, and which was also common in
North America.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Warriors sometimes take the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of a slain enemy, from the same motive apparently
which, in some instances, is an inducement to eat
their flesh, namely, to appropriate their courage.
The Lapps change a child’s baptismal name, if it falls
ill, rebaptizing it at every illness, as if they thought
to deceive the spirit that vexed it by the simple
stratagem of an <i>alias</i>;<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and the Californian Shoshones,
in changing their names after such feats as scalping
an enemy, stealing his horses, or killing a grizzly
bear, had, perhaps, some similar idea of avoiding retaliation.
Among the Chinook Indians near relations
often changed their names, lest the spirits of the
dead should be drawn back to earth by often hearing
familiar names used.</p>

<p>With these ideas about names it is easy to understand
how especial reverence would become attached
to the names of kings or dead persons whose power
to punish a light use of their appellations might well
be deemed exceptional. On accessions to royalty in
the Society Islands all words resembling the king’s
name were changed, and any person bold enough to
continue the use of the superseded terms was put to
death, with all his relations.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> From a similar state
of thought the Abipones invented new words for all
things whose previous names recalled a dead person’s
memory, whilst to mention his name was ‘a nefarious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
proceeding.’<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> In Dahome the king’s name must be
pronounced with bated breath, and it is death to
utter it in his presence.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The degrees of guilt, attached
to the mention of a dead person, arising from a belief
in the power of spoken names to call back their
owners, vary in sinfulness from its being a positive
crime, punishable by fine, to a mere rudeness, to be
checked in the young. Among the Northern Californians
it was one of the most strenuous laws that
whoever mentioned a dead person’s name should be
liable to a heavy fine, payable to the relatives.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The
tribe of Ainos held it a great rudeness to speak of
the dead by their names; whilst young Ahts are instantly
checked, if they make an unthinking use of
the name of a chief that has been relinquished in
memory of some event of importance.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Several causes may have led to animal worship.
The tendency to call men by qualities or peculiarities
in them fancifully recalling those of some animal, and
the tendency to apotheosize distinguished ancestors,
thus named after the tiger or the bear, may have led
to a confusion of thought between the animal and
the man, till the divine attributes, once attached to
the individual, became transferred to the species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
animal that survived him in constant existence. Or
the same fancy, which sees inspiration in an idiot
from his very lack of common reason, may have attributed
peculiar wisdom and looked with peculiar
awe on the animal world, by very reason of its
speechlessness. Then, again, the idea that the bodies
of animals may be the depositories of departed human
souls may have led to the worship of certain animals:
some Californians for this reason refraining from the
flesh of large game, because it is animated by the
souls of past generations, so that the term ‘eater of
venison’ is one of reproach among them. Or the
prohibitions of shamans may have produced the
result in some cases: the Thlinkeet Indians being
found, for this reason, abstinent from whale’s flesh or
blubber, whilst both are commonly eaten by surrounding
tribes. But, whatever the original causes may have
been, tribes are found all over the world beset with a
feeling of sinfulness with regard to the injuring, eating,
or in any way offending different species of animals;
of which, as no extreme instance, may be mentioned
the Fijian custom of presenting a string of new nuts,
gathered expressly, to a land crab, ‘to prevent the
deity leaving with an impression that he was
neglected, and visiting his remiss worshippers with
drought, dearth, or death.’</p>

<p>Beyond, however, customs or ideas in prevention
of acts prejudicial to their real or supposed welfare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
savage communities appear to have little idea of
any quality in actions rendering them good or bad independently
of consequences. Their prayers, their
beliefs, and their mythology, alike go to prove this.
That they will pray for such temporal blessings as
health, food, rain, or victory, but not for such moral
gains as the conquest of passion or a truthful disposition,
to some extent justifies the inference that
moral advancement forms no part of their code of
things desirable. Their good and evil spirit or spirits
are simply distinguished, where they are distinguished
at all, as the causes respectively of things agreeable or
disagreeable, as taking sides for or against struggling
humanity, so that tribes which pay and sacrifice to the
source of evil, to the neglect of that of good, cannot
be said not to conform to reason. Their mythology,
again, owes its very monotony mainly to the lack of
moral interest to relieve and sustain it. As Mr. Grote,
arguing from the mythology to the moral feeling of
legendary Greece, observes, that such a sentiment as
a feeling of moral obligation between man and man
was ‘neither operative in the real world nor present
to the imaginations of the poets,’ so it may be said
not less emphatically of extant savage mythology.
The Polynesian idea of a god, it has been well said, is
mere <i>power</i> without any reference to goodness. The
divine denizens of Avaiki (the Hades of the Hervey
Islands), as they marry, quarrel, build, and live just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
like mortals, so they murder, drink, thieve, and lie
quite in accordance with terrestrial precedents.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The
unethical nature, however, of savage prayer or mythology
is obviously not incompatible with the practical
recognition of certain moral distinctions; in the same
Hervey Islands, for instance, the greatest possible sin
was to kill a fellow-countryman by stealth, instead of
in battle.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Ideas, again, relating to a future state and the dependence
of future welfare on the mode of life spent on
earth, though they would seem to afford some insight
into the moral sentiments of those holding them, in
default of definition of the good or bad conduct so
rewarded or punished, do not really prove much. In
the following instances, which offer several shades of
variety, there is scarcely any attempt at moral definition,
and the native belief has, perhaps, been
adulterated by Christian influence. The Good Spirit
of the Mandans dwelt in a purgatory of cold and
frost, where he punished those who had offended him,
before he would admit them to that warmer and
happier place, where the Bad Spirit dwelt and sought
to seduce the happy occupants.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> For the Charocs of
California were two roads, one strewn with flowers,
and leading the good to the bright Western land, the
other bristling with thorns and briers, and leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the wicked to a place full of serpents. The souls of
Chippewyans drifted in a stone canoe to an enchanted
island in a large lake; if the good actions of their life
predominated they were wafted safely ashore; but if
the bad, the canoe sank beneath their weight, leaving
the wretches to float for ever, in sight of their lost
and nearly won felicity. Wicked Okanagans, again,
a Columbian tribe (and by the wicked are here
specified murderers and thieves), went to a place
where an evil spirit, in human form, with equine ears
and tail, belaboured them with a stick.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The Fijian
belief appears truer to savage thought; for whilst such
of their dead as succeeded in reaching Mbula were
happy or not, according as they had lived so as to
please the gods, mortals subjected to special punishment
were persons who had not their ears bored,
women who were not tattooed, and men who had not
slain an enemy.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Taking, however, these instances at their best,
there is nothing to show that the good or bad, rewarded
or punished as above described, were really
anything more than those who on earth had fought
and hunted with courage or cowardice. Writers
citing such beliefs do not always make allowance for
the difference between the savage and the civilised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
moral standard. The code to be observed, says
Schoolcraft, in order for the soul to pass safely the
stream which leads to the land of bliss, ‘appears to
be, as drawn from their funeral addresses, fidelity
and success as a hunter in providing for his family,
and bravery as a warrior in defending the rights and
honour of his tribe. There is no moral code regulating
the duties and reciprocal intercourse between
man and man.’<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> And if the good American Indians
above mentioned were distinguished by any higher
moral attributes than those of mere bravery and
activity, it is difficult to account for the fact that,
while Mexican civilisation consigned all who died
natural deaths, good and bad alike, to the dull repose
of Mictlan, reserving for the higher pleasures of futurity
those who met their deaths in war or water, or from
lightning, disease, or childbirth, tribes whose culture
stood to that of Mexico as far removed as that of
Polynesia from that of Europe, should have attained
to the moral belief of the influence of earthly conduct
reaching beyond the grave.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing brief review of some of the real
evidence on the subject would seem to indicate the
conclusion that, in matters of morals, savages are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
neither so low as they have been painted by most
writers nor so blameless as they have been portrayed
by some. Their faults, such as their vindictiveness,
their ingratitude, or their mendacity, might be predicated
as easily of communities the most advanced
in the world; nor, in the face of the great neglect of
precision of language in all narratives of travel, can
any evidence of the utter ignorance of right and wrong
among any tribe lay claim to the smallest scientific
value. Of the African Yorubas, whilst one writer
asserts that they are not only covetous and cruel, but
‘wholly deficient in what the civilised man calls conscience,’
of the same people another says that they
have several words in their language to express honour,
and ‘more proverbs against ingratitude than perhaps
any other people.’<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps no description of savage character is fairer
than Mariner’s of the Tongan Islanders. ‘Their notions,’
he says, ‘in respect to honour and justice are
tolerably well-defined, steady, and universal; but in
point of practice both the chiefs and the people, taking
them generally, are irregular and fickle, being in some
respects extremely honourable and just, and in others
the contrary, as a variety of causes may operate.’<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
But the justice of such remarks is lost in their vagueness,
and their impartial generality would render them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of world-wide rather than of merely local or insular
application.</p>

<p>If, therefore, in consideration of the unsatisfactory
nature of the direct evidence, we resort to the indirect
for the materials of our judgment, we shall perhaps
not err widely from the truth if we say that average
savage morality coincides very much with that of any
contemporary remote village of the civilised world,
where the fear of retaliation and disgrace is the chief
preventive of great wickedness, and the natural play
of the social affections the main safeguard of good
order. The statement calls for but few limitations,
that wherever travellers have explored, or missionaries
taught, they have been able to detect
customary laws regulating the relations of civil life,
the orderly transference of property by exchange or
inheritance, no less than the fixed succession to titles
and dignities. They have found not only punishments
for the prevention, but judicial ordeals for the detection,
of crimes; nor is it possible to believe that such
penal laws can exist without ideas of wrongness
attaching to the deeds they prohibit. But, besides
the secular absolution involved in legal penalties,
they have found not unfrequently a kind of spiritual
purification by means of confession, penances, and
fasting; the practice of such confession alone proving
that feelings of remorse are not foreign to savage
races, difficult as it must always be to discriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
between actual remorse for wickedness and the mere
dread of contingent punishment. The greater social
crimes, murder, theft, and adultery, though not recognized
as morally worse than many acts of purely
fanciful badness, are sufficiently prevented by the fear
of revenge or of tribal punishment; and statements
concerning indifference to the immorality of such
actions either do not rest on good evidence or apply
to extra-tribal, that is, to hostile relations. It seems,
therefore, that fundamentally the two extremities of
civilisation are ethically united; each having for its
standard of morality the idea of its own welfare, and
deriving a sense of moral obligation from a more or
less vague dread of consequences. The fundamental
identity of human emotions, of the operations of the
feelings of love, fear, hope, and shame, appear to have
produced, in different stages of culture, very similar
moral feelings; nor is it conceivable that such feelings,
howsoever much weaker, were ever radically
different in the most remote antiquity.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>SAVAGE POLITICAL LIFE.</i></span></h2>

<p>From the accounts of travellers respecting the nature
of government among uncivilised tribes it would not
be a purely baseless theory to construct a scale of
successive developments, ranging from people entirely
destitute of political cohesion to people characterised
by a quite despotic form of government, and agreeing
in the main with the fishing or hunting and the agricultural
stages of human advancement respectively.
The savage idea of monarchy is represented by all
the possible gradations between the most limited and
the most absolute kind of government, and we should
naturally look for the best types of the latter among
tribes where geographical limitations or other causes
have necessitated a stationary and agricultural life.
We should expect to find the first germs of recognised
leadership among people taught by war and the chase
to appreciate superior strength or skill; and to see
such temporary leaders pass into definite political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
chiefs, when a more settled mode of life has given
fixedness to ideas of property and made its defence
more desirable. We might infer <i>à priori</i> that as men
lived by hunting or fishing before they drove flocks,
and drove flocks before they tilled the ground, so they
lived in families before they lived in hordes, and in
hordes before they lived in larger social aggregates.
As representatives of the lowest stage of society, we
might instance the Esquimaux, whom Cranz found
‘destitute of the very shadow of a civil polity;’ and
we might pass from the hunting populations of
America, who only choose rulers for the temporary
purposes of war or the chase, to the despotic forms of
government characteristic of the agricultural communities
of Africa or Polynesia.</p>

<p>It is not, however, worth insisting on an induction
which would be at the mercy of negative instances
drawn from so large a surface as the whole known
globe. To supply only one instance, in which the
hunting state co-exists with a somewhat advanced
political system. Most South American tribes, who
practised husbandry in addition to fishing and hunting
to a far greater extent than North American tribes,
were found, in point of social organisation, at a much
lower level than the Northern tribes, it being possible
to classify the latter into nations by words supplied
by themselves, whilst in the South there were merely
bands, and it was necessary to invent names for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
groups of bands as were allied together by language.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Facts are the test of theories, not theories of facts;
and to insist on fitting facts to a theory is to fall into
the error of the unskilful shoemaker, who transposes
the task of fitting shoes to feet for the easier one of
insisting that feet shall fit his shoes.</p>

<p>Without, therefore, attempting to elaborate theories
about the development of political ideas from their
rudest beginnings to their expression in mature and
complex state-systems, it may not be labour lost to
collect, within readable compass, some estimate of
the notions of sovereignty, the political organisations,
the relations of classes, and the peculiar institutions
found among those communities of the earth who seem
the best representatives of primitive manners and
the least advanced from a state of primitive barbarism.</p>

<p>Statements concerning the total absence of civil
government among savages, like statements concerning
their total ignorance of religion, should be received
with the reserve due to all propositions containing
terms of expansive signification. It is noteworthy
that it is generally tribes declared to be destitute of
all religious feelings who in the same sentence or
paragraph are described as also destitute of political
ties; the statement that a tribe is entirely destitute of
religion or of any civil polity being, in fact, often only
an hyperbolical expression, intended to convey an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
extreme idea of their barbarity. Bushmen, Californians,
and Australians have severally been described
as not only not recognizing any gods, but as not recognizing
any chiefs; but subsequent research having
proved that Bushmen, at least, possess an elaborate
mythology, worshipping the ethereal bodies, and
having their own distinctive myths concerning the
Creation, suspicion is naturally aroused that all
broadly negative assertions of the same sort may be but
the results of insufficient observation.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> ‘The Caribs,’
says one writer, ‘had no chiefs; every man obeyed the
dictates of his passions unrestrained by government
or laws;’ but according to another they lived in hordes
of from forty to fifty persons, under a patriarchal
form of government, and recognized a common chief
whenever they went to war with their neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, however, in countries where excess
of numbers has not driven communities to improve
their condition by raids against their neighbours, and
where, consequently, military skill has attained no
importance nor authority, much looser social bonds
may be found than in places where a sense of property
and of its value has arisen. Among people like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Esquimaux, the Lapps, or the Kamschadals, who
live together in independent families, age is the only
title to authority; and if skill in seal-catching or in
weather-lore procure for a Greenlander the deference
of younger members of his race, he has no power to
compel any of them to follow his counsels, and the
only moral check to a refractory person is a possible
refusal on the part of his fellows to share the same hut
with him. If, in distant voyages, all the boatmen
submit their kajaks to the guidance of their countryman
who is best acquainted with the way, they are at
perfect liberty to separate from him at pleasure.
Beyond this slight tie they have, or had when Cranz
wrote, no political union, no system of taxation or
legislation of any kind, albeit they were not wanting
in methods for the enforcement of certain moral duties
and the prevention of certain moral wrongs. Of the
Kamschadals, Steller tells us that they had no chief,
but that everyone was allowed to live according to his
pleasure; yet that they chose leaders for their expeditions,
who were without even power to decide private
disputes, and that each <i>ostrog</i>, or family settlement, had
its ruler (generally the oldest male), whose power to
punish consisted solely in the right of verbal correction.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>From the condition of the Kamschadals or
Esquimaux to the condition of Eastern Asia or
Polynesia, where a king’s name is often so sacred as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to be avoided altogether, as many gradations of civil
authority exist as otherwise mark the difference of
their respective civilisations. As the progress of an
individual from infancy to old age is marked at each
stage by a strict equipoise of good and evil, varying
only in kind, so every upward step in the social
advancement of mankind seems attended with some
equivalent loss. Individual liberty is greatest where
the social bond is the loosest; and people like the
rude hunting tribes of Brazil, with only their hunting-grounds
to defend and only temporary leaders to
obey, undoubtedly enjoy greater freedom than is compatible
with an agricultural life. As soon as tribes
become settled and practise husbandry they are
naturally impelled to seek the labour of slaves, which
is a thing undesirable when a scanty subsistence is
gained by the exertions of the chase. And when
once the existence of slavery has established a difference
between bondsmen and free, a way is open for
all those artificial divisions of society into ranks and
castes which seem in later times to belong to, nay, to
constitute, the natural order of things.</p>

<p>It is, however, even at lower levels of general
culture, often among tribes who are still in the hunting
stage, that we find all traces disappear of that
condition of freedom and equality once fondly
imagined to belong to a ‘state of nature.’ Savages
seldom constitute pure democracies, in the sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
either of all being equal or of all being free. Even
where the monarchical power is quite rudimentary
well-marked distinctions serve to sever them into aristocracy
and commonalty; for the natural differences
of capacity between men divide them, if less strongly,
not less definitely than slavery. Superiority in
courage, strength, sagacity, or experience, entitles a
savage to much the same privileges that, in more
civilised countries, are allotted to superiority in
wealth or lineage. The conditions, however, of savage
life cause merit, and not birth, to be the primary
qualification both for chieftainship and nobility.
Where military capacity is the sole basis of authority
it follows that such authority only descends to sons,
if they are as gifted as their parents with military
prowess; also, that any commoner may at any time
become a noble if duly qualified for a leader, and that
for the same reason even the female sex is not
excluded from a career of political ambition. Among
the Abipones women were often raised to the dignity
of cacique or captainship of a horde; nor is it rare to
find them capable of occupying positions of similar
dignity among tribes who, in other respects, treat
their women as little better than beasts of burthen.
The Iroquois women, for instance, on whom devolved
all daily labour, such as planting the corn, cutting
and carrying firewood, bearing all burdens when
marching, had their representatives in the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
councils, enjoyed a veto upon declarations of war,
and the right of interposing to bring about a peace.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
Khond wives filled the same important post of
mediators and peace-makers in the wars between
the tribes of their husbands and their parents; and
in Africa, where the position of women is almost
uniformly one of slavery, they are ambassadors,
traders, warriors, sometimes queens, besides tilling
the ground, tending the herds, or working in mines.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>As many savages surround the entrance to their
paradise with imaginary physical difficulties which
only the bravest can overcome, so they frequently
make admission to the rank of their nobility dependent
on the performance of certain rites and ceremonies
which sufficiently attest the endurance of
the aspirant to social elevation. An Indian tribe on
the Orinoco used to lay such a candidate on a hurdle,
place burning coals beneath, and then cover him with
palm-leaves all over, in order to make the heat more
suffocating. Or, they would perhaps anoint him
with honey, and leave him for hours tied to a tree at
the mercy of the insects of those latitudes. The
Abiponian plan was, to place a black bead on a
tribeman’s tongue and insist on his staying at home
for three days, abstaining all the while from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
ordinary pleasures of food, drink, and speech. Then
on the eve of the day of his inauguration all the women
of the horde would come to his tent, in uncouth attire,
and lament loudly for the ancestors of the man who
would fain be a noble. The next day, after galloping
spear in hand on horses decorated with bells and
feathers to the four quarters of the wind, he had to
suffer the priestess of the ceremonies to shave a band
on his head, three inches wide from the forehead
backwards. A eulogy by the old woman, recording
his warlike character and noble actions, concluding
with a change of name befitting his change of rank,
completed the ceremony of his installation. In
ancient Mexico a candidate for the noble order of the
Tecuhtli had to remain impassive whilst the high
priest insulted him, whilst the assistant priests mocked
him as a coward and tore his clothes from his body,
and all this previous to a noviciate which lasted two
years, and ended with four days of severe penance,
fastings, and prayers.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The prevalence, indeed, of equality among savages
is one of those fictions which date from the time when
writers drew on their own minds for a knowledge of
anthropology: a fiction due to the same tendency
which created for the Greeks their Elysian Fields, or
for the Tongan islanders their Bolotu, leading them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to refer to the distant or the unknown the actualisation
of those longings and ideals which the immediate
surroundings of the world could not gratify. But the
truth is, that so firmly among most savages has the
idea become fixed of an essential difference in the
nature of nobles and commons, of governors and
governed, that the demarcations of their mundane
economy are transferred into their speculations about
the unseen world, and the inequalities of this life are
often perpetuated in the next. New Zealanders believed
that, whilst all spirits at death went as falling
stars to Reinga, or the lower world, those of chiefs
went first of all to heaven, where their left eye remained
as a star.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Among the Zulus the snakes into
which departed chiefs turn are easily distinguishable
from those which embody commoner people.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> As
paupers and bondsmen were not admitted to Valhalla,
so the ‘masses’ of the Tongan islanders have neither
souls nor futurity. The Dahomans who call this
world their plantation and the next their home, believe
that in the latter ‘the king is a king and the slave a
slave for ever and ever.’<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> In Samoa not only had chiefs
a larger hole than plebeians by which to descend to
the under world, but also a separate habitation, serving
as columns to support the temple of the underground
god, and enjoying the best of food and all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pleasures.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Whilst the Thlinkeets burnt most bodies,
that they might be warm in their new home, slaves
were buried, as only deserving to freeze there; and the
Ahts, allotting a plenteous and sunny land in the sky
to dead chiefs, relegate persons of low degree to a subterranean
abode, where the houses are poor, the deer
small, and the blankets thin.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Devices have varied all over the world for marking
the innate or acquired differences between men. The
Tibboos of Africa denote difference of rank by different
scars on the face; but distinctions in dress or in titles
have been the usual resort of the civilised and semi-civilised
world alike; and the highest Fijian chiefs,
who would style themselves the ‘subjects of Heaven
only,’ were prompted by the same natural vanity that
gave birth among ourselves to the ‘Knights of the
Lion and Sun’ or to the doctrine of the divine right
of kings. But the most striking device in the lower
grades of civilisation is the conscious invention and
use of a different form of speech, amounting almost to
the use of a different language, such as was the plan
adopted by the Abipones to mark the difference between
noble and plebeian. Persons advanced to the
rank of nobles, or the Hocheri, were not only distinguished
from their fellows by a change of name
(men adding the suffix <i>in</i>, women <i>en</i>, to their former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
appellation), but the whole language spoken by the
Hocheri was, by the insertion or addition of syllables,
so altered from the vulgar tongue as to amount to a
distinct aristocratic dialect.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> It is remarkable how a
similar practice prevails in widely remote parts of the
globe. Among Circassians the language for the common
people is one, that for the princes and nobility
another; nor may the commonalty, though they
understand it, venture to speak in the secret or court
language.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> ‘As in the Malayan so in the Fijian language,
there exists an aristocratical dialect,’ and in
some places ‘not a member of a chiefs body or the
commonest acts of his life are mentioned in ordinary
phraseology, but are all hyperbolised.’<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> In the Sandwich
Islands ‘the chiefs formed a conventional dialect,
or court language, understood only among themselves.
If any of its terms became known by the lower orders
they were immediately discarded and others substituted.’<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
So, too, it is said that the island Caribs held
their war councils in a secret dialect, known only to
the chiefs and elders, into which they were initiated
after attaining distinction in war.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Of the Society
Islanders, Ellis tells us that ‘sounds in the language
composing the names of the king and queen could no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
longer be applied to ordinary significations’—a rule,
he adds, which brought about many changes in the
words used for things.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Lastly, in the Tongan islands
something of the same kind also prevailed, for there
we find that among the ways of paying special honour
to the Tooitonga, or divine chief, was the employment,
in speaking with him, of words devoted exclusively
to his use, as substitutes for words of ordinary
parlance.</p>

<p>Another method by which savages seek to mark
the different grades of society is to signalise by an
excess of demonstration their sorrow for the departure
of persons of rank from among them. The custom of
cutting off finger-joints in token of grief, from its
prevalence among the Blackfeet Indians of North
America, the Hottentots of South Africa, some tribes
of Australia, and among the female portion of the
Charruas of South America, may be considered to
rank among the remarkable analogies of world-culture,
when we find that a similar custom prevailed also
among the Tongan Islanders whenever the death of a
chief or a superior relation left his survivors comfortless.
It is possible that the idea of propitiating angry
gods by self-inflicted pains may have originally underlain
many of the practices in after times regarded
as mere manifestations of grief; for Captain Cook,
speaking of the knocking out of front teeth at funerals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
says that he always understood that this custom,
like that of cutting off finger-joints, was not inflicted
from any violence of grief so much as intended
for a propitiatory sacrifice to the Atoa, to avert
any possible danger or mischief from the survivors.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Thus Bushmen sacrifice the end joints of their fingers
in sickness; and during the illness of a Tooitonga his
countrymen would seek to appease the god whose
anger had caused the disease by the sacrifice daily of
the little finger of a young relation. Mariner mentions
two patriotic young Tonganers contesting with fist
and foot the right thus to testify their regard for the
lord of their country. It is easily conceivable how a
practice, begun with the idea of conciliating the
cause of a disease, might be continued for the purpose
of conciliating the cause of death, and thus how
(as in Fiji, where on the death of a king orders were
issued that one hundred fingers should be cut off) an
archaic superstition might pass into a meaningless
formality.</p>

<p>There are, however, various other ways of exhibiting
regret for departed nobility. In the Sandwich
Islands, if a chief dies, the highest mark of respect
his survivors can show is to strike out one of their
front teeth with a stone. They also tattoo their
tongues, deprive themselves of an ear, or shave their
heads in fantastic designs. The latter is a world-wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
symbol of sorrow; more peculiar is the license to rob
and burn houses and commit other enormities, which
is, or was once, customary in Hawaii on the death of
a chief. In Tonga and Tahiti it was customary on
such occasions to cut the forehead and breast with
sharks’ teeth. Axes, clubs, knives, stones, or shells
were employed freely for self-mutilation, when Finow,
the King of Tonga, died; his disconsolate subjects
seeking to induce him, by the energy of their blows
and the loudness of their prayers, to lay aside those
suspicions of their loyalty which had prompted him
to depart from Tonga to Bolotu.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>In modern civilised life such clear distinctions
exist no longer, but there is at least one symbol
of nobility which bears distinct traces of descent
from uncivilised conceptions and usages. From the
common practice of making a particular species of
animal the totem, or representative, of a particular
person, family, or tribe, arose probably the custom of
distinguishing persons or families by crests, figurative
of their patron animals. Both among the Kolushs, a
fishing North American tribe, and their neighbours,
the Haidahs, of Queen Charlotte’s Island, the existence
of an aristocracy of birth is proved from the
presence of family crests among them, derived from
figures of certain animals. Sir G. Grey noticed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Australia that each family adopted some animal or
vegetable for its crest or Kobong,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and the hereditary
nobility of the rude Thlinkeet Indians paint or
carve the heraldic emblem of their clan on their
houses, boats, robes, shields, or wherever else they
can find room for it.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> These few instances from
the lower culture suffice to explain how animal
figures, supposed to be expressive of the character
of gods or warriors, came to be worn above their
helmets; and how in the case of warriors at least,
they gradually passed from their helmets to their
shields, till they became part of armorial bearings, so
highly prized and zealously transmitted from generation
to generation. Newton, the author of the
‘Display of Heraldry,’ expresses his belief that the
most ancient class of crests were taken from ferocious
animals, which were regarded as figuratively representing
the bearer and his pursuits. Certain it is that
a far larger proportion of crests are derived from the
animal world, from beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, and
even insects, than from any other sublunary class of
things.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>If now we turn to the savage conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
monarchy, we shall find that, wherever regal authority
exists, it is sustained by a more or less strong belief
in the divine origin of kings. The constitutional
power of a king varies with the amount of divinity
ascribed to him. As Russians of the sixteenth
century held the will of their Grand Duke to be the
will of God, and whatever he did to be done by the
will of God,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> so now in Africa the king of Loango is
not only honoured as a god, but known by the same
name as the Deity; namely, Samba. His subjects,
accrediting him with power over the elements, pray
to him for rain in times of drought. But as a king’s
divine origin means his divine right, or in other words
his despotic power, his subjects only enjoy their lives
and property on the tenure of his will, nor does there
seem any moral limitation to his regal rights, save an
obligation to make use of native products and dresses.
The king of Dahomey, also revered as a god, appears
to possess power over his countrymen which is only
so far limited, that he cannot behead princes of the
blood royal but must confine his vengeance against
them to strangulation or slavery. Without his leave
no caboceer may alter his house, wear European
shoes, or carry an umbrella. Many kings of the Fiji
Islands claimed a divine origin and asserted the rights
of deities, their persons indeed being so religiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
revered that even in battle their inferiors would fear
to strike them. In Tahiti, Oro, the chief god, was
called the king’s father, and the same homage that
was paid to the gods and their temples was paid also
to the king and his dwellings, the homage, namely, of
stripping to the waist. At his coronation the king
asserted his dominion over the sea, by being rowed in
Oro’s sacred canoe and receiving congratulation from
two divine sharks. So that it was no mere spirit of
bombastic adulation that caused the king’s houses to
be identified, in popular parlance, with the Clouds of
Heaven, the lights in them with the Lightning, or his
canoe with the Rainbow; and if his voice was described
as the Thunder, it doubtless was due to that
common association of electricity with divinity, such
as, for instance, prompted the savages of Chili to
employ the same name for Thunder and for God.
The ceremony of creating a Tahitian king consisted
in girding him with a girdle of red feathers, which, as
they were taken from the chief idols, were thought
to be capable of conferring on the monarch the divine
attributes of power and vengeance. That a human
sacrifice was essential, not only at the commencement
and completion of the girdle, but often for every
piece successively added to it, confirms the experience
of all ages and countries respecting the tendency
of monarchical governments in barbarous times, a
tendency which was never better appreciated than by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the ancient Japanese. For they used to make their
prince sit crowned on his throne for some hours
every morning, without suffering him to move his
hands or feet, his head or eyes, or indeed any part
of his body, believing that by this means alone could
peace and tranquillity be preserved; and ‘if unfortunately
he turned himself on one side or the other,
or if he looked a good while towards any part of his
dominions, it was apprehended that war, famine, fire,
or some other great misfortune was near at hand to
desolate the country.’<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The Samoans thought also
that some deadly influence radiated from the person
of a king which could only be broken by aspersion
with water.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch, however, as government of any kind is
impossible without a subdivision of functions, and a
king needs ministers to execute his will, the limitation
of a council is almost inseparable from even the most
absolute monarchy. A perfectly pure despotism exists,
therefore, nowhere save in the definitions of the
science of politics. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive
an arbitrary government except as a synonym for
total anarchy. In Loango, where the king nominates
and displaces his officers at pleasure, and is absolute
disposer of his subjects’ lives and liberties, armed
resistance is said to be often made against him, and
his power to depend on his wealth and connections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Even a king of Dahomey said that he would imperil
his life if he attempted to put down slavery and
human sacrifices all at once, and it is said that whatever
despotic acts may be witnessed in Africa they
are all performed according to the common law of
the land.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Among the Ashantees there are four men
at the head of the nobility who exert great influence
and serve to balance the monarchical power.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Among
the Kaffirs, the chiefs of hordes, though with power
of life and death, are restrained by the councillors
they themselves nominate from attacking ancient
usages; and though the king is despotic, his despotism
must not transgress known laws. The right of
desertion also which practically belongs to every
member of a horde, acts as a most effectual moral
check upon tyrannical tendencies. Indeed, throughout
Africa, the differentiation of functions of government,
or the division of political labour, is carried to
an extent which proves how little necessary connection
there is between high political capacity and high
culture in other respects. In Dahomey, where a
man’s life is less sacred than that of a fox in England,
there are two chief ministers in constant attendance
on the king, a third who is commander-in-chief of
the army, and a fourth who superintends the due
punishment of crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The existence, again, of grades of society, clearly
marked by differences of functions and privileges, is
itself a proof of a political organisation which
implies limitations to the exercise of sovereignty.
Classes with distinct rights and relations prove the
constraint of a public law which even monarchs must
recognise and respect. In Fetu in Africa, where
frequently from four to five hundred slaves are killed
at a king’s funeral to serve him beyond the grave,
there is a distinct class of freemen, with specific rights,
sprung from the noble and slave classes. So, also,
wherever the Malay race has settled in the Pacific,
their feudal institutions and classes bear a striking
resemblance to those of mediæval Europe. In the
Fiji Islands, such classes are said to be so clearly
defined as to amount almost to a system of caste.
They are:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The kings and queens.</p>

<p>2. Chiefs of large dependent islands or districts.</p>

<p>3. Chiefs of towns, and priests.</p>

<p>4. Warriors of low birth; chiefs of carpenters and
of turtle-fishers.</p>

<p>5. The people.</p>

<p>6. The slaves taken in war.</p>

</div>

<p>With which may be compared the Tongan social
scale:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The Tooitonga and Veachi, chiefs of divine
descent.</p>

<p>2. The king, or How.</p>

<p>3. The Egi, or nobles; all persons in any way
related to the two former classes.</p>

<p>4. The priests.</p>

<p>5. The Matabooles, attendants on chiefs, managers
of ceremonies, preservers of records, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. The Mooas, or younger sons or brothers of the
Matabooles.</p>

<p>7. The Tooas, or common people, who practise
such arts as are not dignified enough to pass
from father to son, as cookery, club carving,
shaving, or tattooing.</p>

</div>

<p>These ranks are so fixed and unalterable that they
form a prominent feature in the Tongan conception
of a future world. Rank, not merit, constitutes the
title of admission to Bolotu. All <i>noble</i> souls arrive
there and enjoy a power similar but inferior to that
of the original deities, being capable, like the latter,
of inspiring priests living on earth. The Matabooles
also gain admittance to Bolotu, but are unable to
cause priestly inspirations. The souls of the Tooas
dissolve with the body, as too plebeian to find a place
in Paradise.</p>

<p>In the Sandwich Islands, there were formerly
three aristocratic orders—the first consisting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
king and queen, their relations, and the chief
councillors; the second of the chiefs of dependent
districts; the third of the chiefs of villages and of
priests. Servile homage from all the inferior classes
was paid to these three orders, but particularly to
the priests and higher chiefs, their very persons and
houses being accounted sacred, and the sight of them
a peremptory signal for prostration. The people, as
in mediæval Europe, were attached to the soil and
transferred with it: but a strong customary law is
said nevertheless to have regulated both the tenure of
land and personal security.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> If they had no voice in
the government, they sometimes took part in public
meetings, nor did the king ever resolve on matters of
weight without the counsel of his principal chiefs.
Yet government was more despotic in the Sandwich
than in either the Society or the Fiji Islands. In
Tahiti, public assemblies were held, in which the
speakers did not hesitate to compare the state to a
ship, of which the king was only the mast, but the
landed nobility the ropes that kept it upright.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Many savage tribes have succeeded, by speciously
devised forms and ceremonies, in clothing arbitrary
power with a cloak of legality, inviolably divine. The
most remarkable of these devices is the famous institution
of <i>tabu</i>, which, by transferring the divinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
inherent in a king or chief to everything that comes
in contact with him, early invested sovereign power
with a most facile and elastic weapon of government.
For the principle, that whatever a king touched
became sacred to his use, supplied regal power with
a most convenient immunity from the shackles of
ordinary morality. A Fijian king, by giving his
dress to an English sailor, enabled the latter to
appropriate whatever food he chose to envelope with
the train of his dress. Whatever house a Tahitian
king or queen enters is vacated by its owners; the
field they tread on becomes theirs; their clothes,
their canoes, the very men who carry them, are invested
with a sanctity the violation of which is death,
and are regarded as precisely as holy as objects
less, ostensibly associated with earthly necessities.</p>

<p>But whether or not the institution of <i>tabu</i> was a
clever invention of kings for increasing their power,
its inevitable extension reacted in time as a limitation
to it. This may be illustrated from the Tongan
Islands, where the regal power, owing probably to a
long constitutional struggle between the rival claims
to sovereignty of birth and merit, stood in a most
anomalous position. For the king did not belong to
the highest rank of the people, his title depending in
part on birth, but principally on his reputation for personal
strength and military capacity. Tooitonga and
Veachi, the direct descendants of the gods who first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
visited the island, or (as we may perhaps rationalistically
translate it) the direct descendants of the earliest
kings, occupied a higher status than the actual king,
and were honoured with acknowledgments of their
divinity which even the king himself had to pay. To
the posterity of bygone monarchs the actual king stood
in the relation of a peasant to a prince, being expected,
like anyone else, to sit down on the ground when they
passed, though they might be his inferiors in wealth
nor possessed of any direct power save over their
own families and attendants. The dignity of the
Tooitonga survived not only in his not being circumcised
nor tattooed as other men, and in peculiar
ceremonies attending his marriage or his burial, but
in the more substantial offerings of the firstfruits of
the year at stated periodical festivals. The king used
to consult him before undertaking a war or expedition,
though often regardless of the counsel offered; and
in reference to the person of either descendant of the
gods the king was subject to tabu, or even in reference
to ordinary chiefs in any way related to them.
If he but touched the body, the dress, or the sleeping
mat of a chief nearer related to Tooitonga and Veachi
than himself, he could only exempt himself from the
inconveniences incurred by the violation of tabu by
the dispensation attached to the ceremony of touching,
with both his hands, the feet of such supernatural
chief, or of some one his equal in rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Society Islands, in consequence of the
regal attribute inseparable from royalty of tabooing
whatever ground it traversed, Tahitian kings became
in course of time either entirely restricted to walking
in their own domains, or subjected to the discomfort
of a progress on servile shoulders over whatever
district they wished to visit. So that tabu in both
these instances acted as a limitation to the despotism
of the king.</p>

<p>In Tahiti, however, the king’s power was further
limited by a custom which, extending as it did to
all the noble classes, was perhaps the most anomalous
institution in the world, whether as regards the theory
or the practice of inherited rank. For the custom
compelling a king or a noble to transfer all his titles
and dignity to his firstborn son at the moment of his
birth, whether instituted originally for securing an
undisputed succession to the regency or due to a
similar rude confusion of ideas, such as associates the
sanctity of a man’s origin with the sanctity of all
he touches, carried the claims of primogeniture to a
degree unknown either by the Jewish or the English
law. ‘Whatever might be the age of the king, his
influence in the state, or the political aspect of affairs
in respect to other tribes, as soon as a son (of noble
birth) was born, the monarch became a subject; the
infant son was at once proclaimed sovereign of the
people; the royal name was conferred upon him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his father was the first to do him homage by saluting
his feet and declaring him king.’ The national herald,
sent round the island with the infant ruler’s flag, proclaimed
his name in every district, and, if it were
acknowledged by the aristocracy, edicts were thenceforth
issued in his name. Not only the homage of
his people, but the lands and other sources of his
father’s power, were transferred to the minor child,
the father only continuing to act as regent till his
child’s capacity for government was matured.</p>

<p>The Fijians also have a peculiar custom, the institution
of Vasu, which serves as a barrier both to
regal and aristocratic oppression, and shows how,
even among savages, the caprice of individuals is held
in bondage by the traditions of the elders. Vasu
signifies the common-law right of a nephew to appropriate
to his own use anything he chooses belonging
to an uncle or to anyone under his uncle’s power.
The king often availed himself of Vasu for his own
benefit, it being customary for a nephew to surrender
as tribute most of the legal extortions which his title of
Vasu might enable him to levy. But the king himself
was liable to Vasu; for we are told that, ‘however high
a chief may rank, <i>however powerful a king may be</i>, if he
has a nephew he has a master;’ for, except his lands and
his wives, neither chief nor king possessed anything
which his nephew might not appropriate at any
moment. If, for instance, the uncle built a canoe for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
himself, his nephew had only to come, mount the deck,
and sound his trumpet shell, to announce to all the world
a legitimate and indefeasible transfer of ownership. It
is even said that on one occasion a nephew at war with
his uncle actually supplied himself, unresisted, with
ammunition from his enemy’s stores. It is difficult
indeed to divine the origin of so singular an institution,
unless perhaps we regard it as surviving from a time
when as in so many parts of the world nephews and
not sons ranked as first in inheritance. In Loango the
nephews of a deceased king become princes, whilst
his sons descend to the commonalty; the throne of
Ashantee passes not to a man’s natural heir, but to
his brother’s or sister’s son, and the same rule of
descent prevails widely over the world.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>In two respects especially, savages may be accredited
with having secured a certain stability for their
institutions and saved them from some of the dangers
which have been the bane of more civilised countries.
It entitles them to no slight praise that they have
generally so adjusted the relations of the temporal
and spiritual powers as to prevent their clashing, and
have taken its sting from taxation by making the
day of taxpaying a day of public rejoicing. In the
Tongan Islands (before the custom was abolished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a revolutionary king) the tax of the annual payment
of firstfruits to the Tooitonga was almost forgotten in
the grand ceremonies with which it was associated,
and tributes received from inferiors by chiefs came
as much as possible in the way of presents, whilst
so far away as the Slave Coast, the feast of taxpaying
is the great recurring Saturnalia of the year.
In Dahomey income-tax is ‘paid under a polite disguise,’
each man bringing a present to the king in
proportion to his rank, and at an annual festival.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
The feast lasts a whole month; public plays take
place every four or five days; singers chant the king’s
praises and the historical traditions of the country;
and the whole concludes with the ever popular
African entertainment of human sacrifice, on an unlimited
scale. In Fiji also taxpaying was associated
with all that the people love; the time of its taking
place being ‘a high day, a day for the best attire, the
pleasantest looks, and the kindest words; a day for
display.’ The Fijian carried his tribute with every
demonstration of joyful excitement, paying it in with
songs and dances to a king who received it with smiles
and who provided a feast for the happy taxpayers.
So among the Kaffirs the presence of the four royal<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
taxgatherers in the town was the signal for feasting
and amusements, and when payment had been at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
demanded by them they were conducted out of the
town, as they had been welcomed into it, by dancers
and musicians.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>In all the lower communities of the globe the
priest, as the Shaman who can invoke rain, who can
cause or cure diseases, who can detect the unknown
thief, or read the result of a coming battle, may be
revered for his power as a sorcerer, but he seldom
enters into the scheme of the body politic as an
efficient political force. In the Sandwich Islands,
where priestly power was more developed than elsewhere,
the priesthood, though not merely an hereditary
body and possessed of much property in men
and lands, but recipients of the same servile homage
that was paid to the highest chiefs, occupied, nevertheless,
a subordinate position to the governing class.
As the nation retained a chief priest who had charge
of the national god, so each chief retained his own
family priest, whose function it was to follow him to
the battle-field carrying his war-god and to direct the
sacred rites of his house. In New Zealand the tohunga
(or priest) was ‘not significative of a class separated
from the rest by certain distinctions of rank,’ but
was an office open to anyone.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> In the Tongan Islands,
a priest had no respect paid to him beyond what was
due to his family rank, owing to the fact that the title
to the priesthood was dependent on the accident of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
inspiration by some god. Whenever a priest invoked
the gods (and it was generally on a person of the
lower classes that such inspiration fell), the chiefs, nay,
even the king himself, would sit indiscriminately
with the common people in a circle round him, ‘on
account of the sacredness of the occasion, conceiving
that such modest demeanour must be acceptable to
the gods.’<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Whatever the priest then said was deemed
a declaration of the god, and, in accordance with a
confusion of the human voice and the divine, not
unknown elsewhere, the oracle, in speaking, actually
made use of the first person, as though the relation of
himself to the god were not merely one of delegated
authority, but of real and complete identification.
Except, however, on such special occasions, a Tongan
priest was distinguished by no particular dress, nor
invested with any official privileges. In Fiji, also, the
priests ranked below the principal chiefs; and the
chief priest, though, as in Tahiti, it was his office to
perform the ceremony which introduced the monarch
to regal dignity, seems in nowise to have interfered
afterwards with the sovereignty of his temporal lord.
It is remarkable that the power of priestcraft increases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with the increase of civilisation; ultimately serving to
arrest and retard the growth of which it is at once
a symptom and a measure.</p>

<p>If from the foregoing data, collected from the best
accredited missionary sources, it is permissible to
speak in general terms of primitive political life, it
would appear that the social organisation of the lower
races stands at a far higher level than too rapid an
inspection would lead a critic to suspect. Their institutions
are such as to presuppose as much ingenuity
in their evolution as sagacity in their preservation.
Their despotism is never so unlimited but that it
recognises the existence of a customary code beside
and above it; nor is individual liberty ever so unchecked
as to outweigh the advantages or imperil the existence
of a life in common. In short, the subordination of
classes, the belief in the divine right of kings and in
differences ordained by nature between nobles and
populace, the principle of hereditary government
(often so firmly fixed that not even women are excluded
from the highest offices), the prevalence of
feudalism with its ever-recurring wars and revolutions,
not only prove an identity of social instinct which is
irrespective of latitude or race, but prove also among
the lower races the existence of a capacity for self-government,
which is disturbing to all preconceptions
derived from accounts of their manners and superstitions
in other relations of life.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">VI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>SAVAGE PENAL LAWS.</i></span></h2>

<p>If, interpreting the present by the past, and taking as
our standard of the past contemporary savage life, we
endeavour to gain some insight into the origin of
those legal customs and ideas which are so interwoven
with our civilisation, the statements of travellers
relating to the judicial institutions of savage tribes
gain considerably in interest and value. For savage
modes of redressing injuries, of assessing punishment,
of discovering truth, reveal not a few striking points
of resemblance and of contrast to the practices prevalent
in civilised communities; whilst they serve at
the same time to illustrate the natural laws at work in
the evolution of society.</p>

<p>The different stages of progress from the lowest
social state, where the redress of wrongs is left to
individual force or cunning, to the state where the
wrongs of individuals are regarded and punished as
wrongs to the community at large, may be all observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in the customs of modern or recent savage
tribes. Yet instances where the redress of wrongs is
purely a matter of personal retaliation are not really
numerous, occurring chiefly where the rulership of a
tribe is ill-defined and is an exercise of influence
rather than authority, as among the Esquimaux,
the Kamschadals, and some Californian and other
American tribes. In such states of society, though
some political sovereignty is vested in the heads of
the different families, they have but little power either
to make commands or to inflict punishments, so that
self-help is for individuals the first rule of existence.
But generally this deficiency in the legal protection
of life and property is made up for by a principle which
lies at the root of savage law—the principle, that is,
of collective responsibility, of including in the guilt of
an individual all his blood relations jointly or singly.</p>

<p>This consideration of crimes as family or tribal
rather than as personal matters, (the duty of satisfying
the family or tribe of anyone injured devolving upon
the family or tribe of the wrongdoer,) must have
tended in the earliest times to withdraw attention from
the merely personal aspect of injuries and to direct it
to their more social relations. The common test of
likelihood is no bad guide in ethnology; and the
difficulty of conceiving any society of men, even the
most savage, living together absolutely unaffected
by, or uninterested in, wrongs done by one of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
members to another, is only equalled by the difficulty
of finding credible records of any such community.
Even in Kamschatka, where the head of an ostrog
had only the power to punish verbally, a man caught
stealing was held so infamous, that no one would befriend
him, and he had to live thenceforth alone without
help from anybody; whilst, if the habit seemed
inveterate, the thief was bound to a tree, and his
arms bound by a piece of birch-bark to a pole
stretched crosswise; the bark was then ignited, and
the man’s hands, thereby branded, marked his character
in future to all who might be interested in
knowing it.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Even in so rude a tribe as the Brazilian
Topanazes, a murderer of a fellow-tribesman would
be conducted by his relations to those of the deceased,
to be by them forthwith strangled and buried, in
satisfaction of their rights; the two families eating
together for several days after the event as though
for the purpose of reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And several other
tribes, destitute of any chiefs possessing the power or
right to judge or punish, have fixed customs regulating
such offences as theft or murder. Thus the
Nootka Indians avenge or compound for punishable
acts, though their chiefs have little or no voice in the
matter. Where, as among the Haidahs of Columbia,
crime likewise has no legal punishment, murder being
simply an affair to be settled with the robbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
family, we may detect the beginnings of later legal
practices in the occasional agreement among the
leading men to put to death disagreeable members
of the tribe, such as medicine-men, and other great
offenders.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> So that wherever, from causes of war or
otherwise, tribal chieftaincy has become at all fixed
and powerful, we may expect to find the chief or chiefs
called upon to settle disputes between individuals or
families; and thus gradually a way would be found for
the addition of judicial functions to the more primary
duties of government.</p>

<p>From this natural tendency of submitting disputed
claims or the measure of redress to the decision of a
single chieftain or of several, the personal right of
retaliation would soon become a tribal one; and
though ignorant of the science of jurisprudence, most
savage tribes seem early to have learnt to treat torts
or offences against an individual as crimes or offences
against the community, taking as their standard of
punishment the measure of the wrong done to the individual.
The transfer of sovereignty from smaller
units to the tribe is clearly marked in instances where
the chiefs of a tribe try crimes and decide guilt, but
leave the punishment of the offender to the discretion
of the injured persons or family; of which the following
are characteristic illustrations.</p>

<p>According to Catlin, every Indian tribe he visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had a council-house in the middle of their village,
where the chiefs would assemble, as well for the investigation
of crimes as for public business, giving
decisions after trial concerning capital offences, but
leaving the punishment to the nearest of kin, to be inflicted
by him under the penalty of social disgrace,
but free from any control by them as to time, place,
or manner.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> So also on the Gold Coast, where suits
lay at the decision of the caboceros or chiefs, the
original conception of murder appears clearly, in the
practice for the murderer to get generally from the
relations of the deceased some abatement of the
pecuniary penalty affixed by law to his crime; they
being the only persons the criminal had to agree with,
and free to take from him as little as they pleased,
whilst the king had no pretence to any share of the
fine except what he might get for his trouble in
exacting it.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> In the Central African kingdom of
Bornou, a convicted murderer was handed over to
the discretional revenge of the murdered man’s
family.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In Samoa, again, the chief of a village and
the heads of families, forming as they did the judicial
as well as legislative body, might condemn a culprit
to sit for hours naked in the sun, to be hung by
his head, to take five bites from a pungent root, or to
play at ball with a prickly sea-urchin, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the nature of his offence. But one punishment was
especially remarkable, as showing how the right of
punishment originally belonging to the family may
survive in form long after it has in reality passed to
a wider political union. This was the punishment
of binding a criminal hand and foot and carrying
him suspended from a prickly pole run through
between his hands and feet, to the family of the
village against which he had transgressed, and there
depositing him before them, as if to signify that he lay
at their mercy.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> And in the villages of Afghanistan,
where an assembly of the elders act as the judges of
the people, a show is always made of delivering up
the criminal to the accuser and of giving the latter
the chance of retaliating, though it is perfectly understood
that he must comply with the wishes of the
assembly. This instance, therefore, illustrates the two
distinct methods of legal punishment in process of
actual transition from one to the other.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>If then the original standard of punishment was
just that amount of severity which would suffice to
prevent individuals from seeking satisfaction by their
private efforts and avenging their own wrongs, it is
intelligible that penal customs should be cruel in proportion
to their primitiveness. It is distinctly stated
that in Samoa fines in food and property gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
superseded more severe penalties. Yet, in
the face of the very varying penalties found in most
different conditions of culture, it is a subject on which
it is difficult to lay down any rule. Sometimes
murder alone is a capital crime, sometimes theft,
witchcraft, and adultery as well; sometimes all or
some of them are commutable by fine. Nor does it
seem that, wherever an offence is punishable by fine,
the penalty has been mitigated from one originally
more severe. In some cases the chief judges may
have found their interest in assessing a more humane,
and to themselves more profitable, forfeit than that of
life or limb; but savages, living in the most primitive
conditions, seem to have been led by their natural
reason alone to observe fitting proportions between
crime and retribution. For their punishments, in
default generally of imprisonment or banishment, are
not as a rule gratuitously cruel: though as occasional
punishments among the Caffres are mentioned the
application of hot stones to the naked body, or exposure
to the torments of ants;<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and slavery, so
common a punishment in Africa, far from being essentially
cruel, is rather a sign of an amelioration
of manners, of a reasonable willingness to take the
useful satisfaction of a man’s labour in lieu of the
useless one of his life. Severity of the penal code
would rather seem to be a concomitant of growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in civilisation, of stronger and deeper moral feelings,
of a sense of the failure of milder means, than of a
really primitive savagery. On the whole continent
of America no savage tribe ever approached the
Aztecs in cruelty of punishment, nor is it among
people of a ruder type of culture that we should ever
look to find some form of death the penalty alike for
the lightest as for the gravest crimes, for slander no
less than for adultery, for intoxication as much as for
homicide.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>It might naturally be inferred that, because the
laws of savages are unwritten and depend on usage
alone for their preservation, therefore they are entirely
uncertain and arbitrary. This, however, is not often
the case. On few points are the statements of travellers
less vague than on the details of native penal
customs; a fact which is only compatible with their
being both well known and regularly enforced. What
the Abbé Froyart says of the natives of Loango,
may be said of all but the lowest tribes: ‘There is no
one ignorant of the cases which incur the pain of
death, and of those for which the offender becomes
the slave of the person offended.’<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The laws of the
Caffre tribes are said to be a collection of precedents,
of decisions of bygone chiefs and councils, appealing
solely to what has been customary in the past, never to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the abstract merits of the case. There appears, it is
said, to be no uncertainty whatever in their administration,
the criminality of different acts being measured
exactly by a fixed number of cattle payable in atonement.
And the customs reported from Ashantee
manifest a similar sense of the value of fixed penalties.
An Ashantee is at liberty to kill his slave, but is
punished if he kills his wife or child; only a chief can
sell his wife or put her to death for infidelity; whilst
a great man who kills his equal in rank is generally
suffered to die by his own hands. If a man brings
a frivolous accusation against another, he must give
an entertainment to the family and friends of the
accused; if he breaks an Aggry bead in a scuffle, he
must pay seven slaves to the owner. A wife who
betrays a secret forfeits her upper lip, an ear if she
listens to a private conversation of her husband.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Savage also as is the kingdom of Dahomey, arbitrary
power is so far limited, that no sentence of death
or slavery, adjudged by an assembly of chiefs, can
be carried out without confirmation from the throne;
and such a sentence ‘must be executed in the capital,
and notice given of it by the public crier in the
market.’ It is no paradox to say, that human life, even
in Dahomey, enjoys more efficient legal protection at
this day than it did in England in times long subsequent
to the signature of Magna Charta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The forms of legal procedure manifest often no
less regularity than the laws themselves. In Congo
the plaintiff opens his case on his knees to the judge,
who sits under a tree or in a great straw hut built on
purpose, holding a staff of authority in his hand.
When he has heard the plaintiff’s evidence he hears
the defendant, then calls the witnesses, and decides
accordingly. The successful suitor pays a sum to
the judge’s box, and stretches himself at full length
on the ground to testify his gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> In Loango,
the king, acting as judge, has several assessors to
consult in difficult cases, and the suit begins by both
parties making a present to the king, who then proceeds
to hear in turn plaintiff, defendant, and witnesses.
In default of witnesses the affair is deferred,
spies being sent to gather ampler information and
ground for judgment from the talk of the people. In
the public trials of Ashantee ‘the accused is always
heard fully, and is obliged either to commit or exculpate
himself on every point.’ On the Gold Coast a
plaintiff would sometimes defer his suit for thirty
years, letting it devolve on his heirs, if the judges,
the caboceros, from interested motives, delayed to
grant him a trial and thus obliged him to wait, in
hopes of finding less impartial or else more amenable
judges in the future.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Several rules of savage jurisprudence betray
curiously different notions of equity from those of
more civilised lands. The Abbé Froyart was shocked
that, on the complaint of the missionaries to the
King of Loango of nocturnal disturbances round
their dwellings, the king should have issued an ordinance
making the disturbance of the missionaries’
repose a capital crime. The reason the natives gave
him for thus putting slight offences on an equality
with grave ones was, that, in proportion to the ease
of abstinence from anything forbidden, or of the
performance of anything commanded was the inexcusableness
of disobedience and the deserved
severity of punishment. Again, impartiality with
regard to rank or wealth, which is now regarded in
England as a self-evident principle of justice, as a
primary instinct of equity, is by no means so regarded
by savages; for not only is murder often atoned for
according to the rank of the murderer, as on the
Gold Coast or in old Anglo-Saxon law, on the basis,
apparently, of the value to the individual of his loss
in death, but such difference of rank sometimes enters
into the estimate of the due punishment for robbery.
Thus the Guinea Coast negroes thought it reasonable
to punish rich persons guilty of robbery more severely
than the poor, because, they said, the rich were not
urged to it by necessity, and could better spare the
money-fines laid on them. Caffre law distinguishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
broadly and clearly between injuries to a man’s
person and injuries to his property, accounting the
former as offences against the chief to whom he belongs,
and making such chief sole recipient of all
fines, allowing only personal redress where a man’s
property has been damaged. Thus Caffre law divides
itself into lines bearing some analogy to those of our
criminal and civil law: such offences as treason,
murder, assault, and witchcraft entering into the
criminal code, and constituting injuries to the actual
sufferer’s chief; whilst adultery, slander, and other
forms of theft, enter as it were into the civil law, as
injuries for which there are direct personal remedies.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The almost universal test among savages of guilt
or innocence, where there is a want or conflict of
evidence, is the ordeal. At first sight it would appear
that such a practice presupposes a belief in a
personal supernatural deity—that it is, in fact, as it
was in the middle ages, a judgment of God, an
appeal to His decision. If so, a theistic belief would
be of wide extent, for the ordeal is common to very
low strata of culture; but, in consideration of the
savage belief in the personality and consciousness of
natural objects or in spirits animating them, it would
seem best to regard the ordeal simply as a direct
appeal to the decision of such objects or spirits themselves,
or through such objects to the decision of dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ancestors, a means for the discovery of truth that
would naturally suggest itself to the shamanic class.
For it is at the peril of his life that a shaman, or
priest, asserts a title to superior power and wisdom;
and as his skill is tested in every need or peril that
occurs, he is naturally as often called upon to detect
hidden guilt as to bring rain from the clouds, or drive
sickness from the body. Driven, therefore, to his
inventive resources by the demands made upon him,
he thinks out a test which he may really consider just,
or which, by proving fatal to the suspected, may
place alike his ingenuity and the verdict beyond the
reach of challenge. Such ordeals not only often elicit
true confessions of guilt by the very terror they
inspire, so that, according to Merolla, it sufficed for
the Congo wizards to issue proclamations for a
restitution of stolen property under the threat of
otherwise resorting to their arts of detection, but they
are valuable in themselves to the shamanic class from
being easily adapted to the destruction of an enemy
and offering a ready channel for the influx of wealth.
A comparison of some of these tests, which decide
guilt not by an appeal to the fear of falsehood, as an
oath does, but by what is really an appeal to the
verdict of chance, will display so strong a family
resemblance, together with so many local peculiarities,
as to make the origin suggested appear not improbable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Bosman mentions the following ordeals as customary
on the Gold Coast in offences of a trivial
character:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Stroking a red-hot copper arm-ring over the
tongue of the suspected person.</p>

<p>2. Squirting a vegetable juice into his eye.</p>

<p>3. Drawing a greased fowl’s feather through his
tongue.</p>

<p>4. Making him draw cocks’ quills from a clod of
earth.</p>

</div>

<p>Innocence was staked on the innocuousness of the
two former proceedings, on the facility of the execution
of the two latter. For great crimes the water
ordeal was employed, a certain river being endowed
with the quality of wafting innocent persons across it,
how little soever they could swim, and of only drowning
the guilty.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Livingstone mentions the anxiety of negro women,
suspected by their husbands of having bewitched
them, to drink a poisonous infusion prepared by the
shaman, and to submit their lives to the effect of this
drink on their bodies; a judicial method strikingly
similar to the test of bitter waters ordained in the
Book of Numbers to decide the guilt of Jewish wives
whom their husbands had reason to suspect of infidelity.
The Barotse tribe, in Africa, who judge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the guilt of an accused person by the effect of medicine
poured down the throat of a dog or cock, manifest
more humanity in their system of detection.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the best collection of African ordeals
is that given in the voyage of the Capuchin Merolla
to Congo in 1682. In case of treason a shaman
would present a compound of vegetable juices, serpents’
flesh, and such things to the delinquent, who would
die if he were guilty, but not otherwise; it being of
course open to the administrator to omit at will the
poisonous ingredients. Innocence was further proved,
if a man suffered nothing from a red-hot iron passed
over his leg, if he felt no bad effects from chewing the
root of the banana, from eating the poisoned fruit of
a certain palm, from drinking water in which a torch
of bitumen or a red-hot iron had been quenched, or
from drawing a stone out of boiling water. The crime
of theft was proved by the ignition or the non-ignition
of a long thread held at either end by the shaman
and the accused, on the application of a red-hot iron
to the middle. Among the Bongo tribe a murder is
often traced to its source, by making plastic representations
so closely resembling the victim, that at a
feast given with dances and songs the criminal will
generally manifest a desire to leave the company.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>So great in general is the dread of such ordeals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that they often actually serve as the most potent
instruments for the discovery of crimes. In the kingdom
of Loango was kept a fetich in a large basket
before which all cases of theft and murder were
tried; and when any great man died, a whole town
would be compelled to offer themselves for trial for his
murder by kissing and embracing the image, in the
fear of falling down dead if they fancied themselves
guilty. In the space of one year Andrew Battel witnessed
the death of many natives in this way.</p>

<p>In the Tongan Islands the king would call the
people together, and, after washing his hands in a
wooden bowl, command everyone to touch it. From
a firm belief that touching the bowl, in case of guilt,
would cause instantaneous death, refusal to touch it
amounted to conviction.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Among the Fijians, distinguished in so many
points from other savages by originality of conception,
the ordeal of the scarf was the one of greatest dread,
extorting confession, it is said, as effectually as a
threat of the rack might have done. The chief or
judge, having called for a scarf, would proceed, if the
culprit did not confess at the sight of it, to wave it above
his head, till he had caught the man’s soul, bereft of
which the culprit would be sure ultimately to pine
away and die.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the ordeals of the Sandwich Islanders was
one called the ‘shaking-water.’ The accused persons,
sitting round a calabash full of water, were required
in turns to hold their hands above it, that the priest,
by watching the water, might detect, when it trembled,
the presence of guilt. On the Society Islands the
ordeal only differed slightly, the priest reading in the
water the reflected image of the thief, after prayer to
the gods to cause his spirit to be present. The mere
report that such a measure had been resorted to often
led to timely restitutions of stolen goods.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>In Sardinia there is, or was, a well, the waters of
which were supposed to blind a person suspected of
robbery or lying, if he were guilty; otherwise to
strengthen and improve his sight.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The above instances, remarkable for their practical
efficiency no less than for their puerile ingenuity,
suffice to illustrate the nature of savage judicial ordeals
and the extreme variety displayed in their invention.
The identity of many ordeals among different people,
such as that by fire or water, is probably due to the
readiness with which such tests would suggest themselves
to the imagination. ‘He who, holding fire in
his hand,’ said the Indian law, ‘is not burnt, or who,
diving under water, is not soon forced up by it, must
be held veracious in his testimony upon oath;’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the same was the idea in China and Africa as well
as in Europe. That these ordeals, like others, were
originated by the class of shamans, and were traditionally
preserved by them as one of the sources of their
power, derives probability from their close analogy
to the judicial ordeals invented and administered by
the priests of early Europe. The trial by the hallowed
morsel, which decided guilt by the effects of
swallowing a piece of hallowed bread or cheese; the
trial by the cross, when both accuser and accused
were placed under a cross with their arms extended,
and the wrong adjudged to him who first let his hands
fall; or the trial by the two dice, when innocence
was proved if the first dice taken at hazard bore the
sign of the cross—though they may have been metamorphosed
heathen ordeals, seem rather to have been
of pure Christian invention; nor are they distinguished
in any point above corresponding practices on the
coast of Guinea, except in this, that they were called
the judgments of God, and implied some belief in a
personal spirit, who could and would control the verdict
of chance to prove guilt or innocence.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>As in Europe after the fifteenth century the oath
of canonical purgation gradually displaced the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
system of ordeals, so it would seem that in savage life
too the judicial oath succeeds in order of time the
judicial ordeal. An oath implies a prayer, an invocation
of punishment in case of perjury; and a man’s
conscience is evidently more directly appealed to
where his guilt is tested to some extent by his own
confession, than where it is decided by something
quite external to himself.</p>

<p>The witness in a modern English law court, invoking
upon himself divine wrath if he swear falsely by
the book he kisses, preserves with curious exactitude
the judicial oath of savage times and lands. Our
English judicial oath, in use though no longer compulsory,
has withstood all attacks upon it, for the insuperable
practical reason that the majority of men
are more afraid of swearing falsely than of speaking
falsely, and that the fewer scruples a man feels about
lying, the more he is likely to feel about perjury.
The notion that one is morally worse than the other
is probably due to the imaginary terrors which, associated
time out of mind with perjury, have given it a
legal existence apart, and made it, so to speak, a kind
of lying-extraordinary, a crime outside the jurisdiction
of humanity.</p>

<p>In Samoa, as at Westminster, physical contact
with a thing adds vast weight to the value of a man’s
evidence. Turner relates how in turn each person
suspected of a theft was obliged before the chiefs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
touch a sacred drinking-cup, made of cocoa-nut, and
to invoke destruction upon himself if he were the
thief. The formula ran: ‘With my hand on this cup,
may the god look upon me and send swift destruction
if I took the thing which has been stolen.’ ‘Before
this ordeal the truth was rarely concealed,’ it being
firmly believed that death would ensue, were the cup
touched and a lie told. Or the suspected would first
place a handful of grass on the stone or other representative
of the village god, and laying his hands on
it, say, ‘In the presence of our chiefs now assembled,
I lay my hand on the stone; if I stole the thing, may
I speedily die,’ the grass being a symbolical curse of
the destruction he invoked on all his family, of the
<i>grass</i> that might grow over their dwellings. The
older ordeal of fixing the guilt upon a person to whom
the face of a spun cocoa-nut pointed when it rested,
shows how ordeals may survive in use after the attainment
of judicial oaths and contemporaneously with
them.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>To understand the binding force of oaths among
savages it is necessary to observe how closely connected
they are with savage ideas of fetichism and
their belief in witchcraft as a really active natural
force. The hair or food of a man, which a savage
burns to rid himself of an enemy, is no mere symbol
of that enemy so much as in some sense that enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
himself. The physical act of touching the thing
invoked has reference to feelings of casual connection
between things, as in Samoa, where a man, to attest
his veracity, would touch his eyes, to indicate a wish
that blindness might strike him if he lied, or would
dig a hole in the ground, to indicate a wish that he
might be buried in the event of falsehood. In Kamschatka,
if a thief remained undetected, the elders
would summon all the ostrog together, young and
old, and, forming a circle round the fire, cause certain
incantations to be employed. After the incantations
the sinews of the back and feet of a wild sheep were
thrown into the fire with magical words, and the wish
expressed that the hands and feet of the culprit might
grow crooked; there being apparently a connection
assumed between the action of the fire on the animal’s
sinews and on the limbs of the man. And in Sweden
there are still cunning men who can deprive a real
thief of his eye, by cutting a human figure on the bark
of a tree and driving nails and arrows into the representative
feature. But perhaps the best illustration
of this feeling is the practice of the Ostiaks, who offer
their wives, if they suspect them of infidelity, a handful
of bear’s hairs, believing that, if they touch them
and are guilty, they will be bitten by a bear within
the space of three days. It would seem that oaths
appeal to the same idea of vicarious or representative
influence, a real but invisible connection being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
imagined between the actual thing touched and the
calamity invoked in touching it.</p>

<p>Instances from the oaths of other tribes will manifest
the operation of the same feeling as that which
makes grass a symbol of utter ruin in Samoa, or some
bear’s hairs of a bear’s bite among the Ostiaks.</p>

<p>North Asiatic tribes have in use three kinds of
oaths, the first and least solemn one being for the
accused to face the sun with a knife, pretending to fight
against it, and to cry aloud, ‘If I am guilty, may the
sun cause sickness to rage in my body like this knife!’
The second form of oath is to cry aloud from the tops
of certain mountains, invoking death, loss of children
and cattle, or bad luck in hunting, in the case of guilt
being real. But the most solemn oath of all is to
exclaim, in drinking some of the blood of a dog,
killed expressly by the elders and burnt or thrown
away, ‘If I die, may I perish, decay, or burn
away like this dog.’<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Very similar is the oath in Sumatra,
where, a beast having been slain, the swearer
says, ‘If I break my oath, may I be slaughtered as
this beast, and swallowed as this heart I now consume.’<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
The most solemn oath of the Bedouins, that of the cross-lines,
is also characterised by the same belief which
appears in the case of the slain beast affecting with
sympathetic decay anyone guilty of perjury. If a
Bedouin cannot convict a man he suspects of theft it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is usual for him to take the suspected before a sheikh
or kady, and there to call upon him to swear any oath
he may demand. If the defendant agrees, he is led
to a certain distance from the camp, ‘because the
magical nature of the oath might prove pernicious to
the general body of Arabs were it to take place in
their vicinity.’ Then the plaintiff draws with his
sekin, or crooked knife, a large circle in the sand with
many cross-lines inside it, places his right foot inside
it, causes the defendant to do the same, and makes
him say after himself, ‘By God, and in God, and
through God, I swear I did not take the thing, nor is
it in my possession.’ To make the oath still more
solemn, the accused often puts also in the circle an
ant and a bit of camel’s skin, the one expressive of a
hope that he may never be destitute of camel’s milk,
the other of a hope that he may never lack the winter
substance of an ant.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Firm, however, as is the savage belief that the
consequences of perjury are death or disease, a belief
which shows itself not unfrequently in actually inferring
the fact of perjury from the fact of death,
escape from the obligation of an oath is not unknown
among savages. On the Guinea Coast recourse was
had to the common expedient of priestly absolution,
so that when a man took a draught-oath, imprecating
death on himself if he failed in his promise, the priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
were sometimes compelled to take an oath too, to the
effect that they would not employ their absolving
powers to release him. In Abyssinia a simpler process
seems to be in vogue; for the king, on one occasion
having sworn by a cross, thus addressed his servants:
‘You see the oath I have taken; I scrape it clean
away from my tongue that made it.’ Thereupon he
scraped his tongue and spat away his oath, thus validly
releasing himself from it.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear that savages refine on their
motives for punishment, the sum of their political
philosophy in this respect being rather to inflict
penalties that accord with their ideas of retribution
deserved for each case or crime, than to deter other
criminals by warning examples. The statement that
New Zealanders beat thieves to death, and then hung
them on a cross on the top of a hill, as a warning
example, conflicts with another account which says
that thieves were punished by banishment.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> But,
subject to the influence of collateral circumstances,
savage penal laws appear to be as fixed, regular, and
well-known, as inflexibly bound by precedent, as often
improved by the intelligence of individual chiefs, as
penal laws are in more advanced societies. The case
of an Ashantee king, who, limiting the number of lives
to be sacrificed at his mother’s funeral, resisted all
importunities and appeals to precedent for a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
number, is not without parallel in reforms of law.
Thus we may read of one Caffre chief who abolished in
his tribe the fine payable for the crime of approaching
a chief’s krall with the head covered by a blanket;
whilst another chief made the homicide of a man taken
in adultery a capital offence, thus transferring the
punishment for the crime from the individual to the
tribe.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>In legal customs analogous to those of the savage
or rather semi-civilized world, the legal institutions of
civilized countries, their methods of procedure, of
extorting truth, of punishing crimes, seem to have
their root and explanation. For this reason the same
interest attaches to the legal institutions of modern
savages as attaches to the laws of the ancient
Germanic tribes or to the ordinances of Menu, the interest,
that is, of descent or relationship. The oath,
for instance, of our law courts presupposes in the
past, if not in the present, precisely the same state
of thought as the oath customary in Samoa; and
the same virtue inherent in touching and kissing the
Bible in England, or the cross in Russia, leads the
Tunguse Lapp to touch and then kiss the cannon,
gun, or sword, by which he swears allegiance to
the Russian crown.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The Highlander of olden time,
kissing his dirk, to invoke death by it if he lied, is
a similar instance of the survival of the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
conception, that physical contact with a thing creates
a spiritual dependence upon it. The ordeal, so lately
the judicial test of witchcraft, still retains a foothold
of faith among our country people, as is proved by the
fact that not longer ago than 1863 an octogenarian
died in consequence of having been ‘swum’ as a
wizard at Little Hedingham, in Essex. And, lastly,
the English law that no person could inherit an estate
from anyone convicted of treason, or from a suicide,
shows how naturally the savage law of collective
responsibility, in reality so unjust, may survive into
times of civilisation, whilst the ignominy still attached
to the blood-relations of a criminal shows with what
difficulty the feeling is eradicated.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">VII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>EARLY WEDDING CUSTOMS.</i></span></h2>

<p>Amid the wonderful uniformity which pervades the
thoughts and customs of the world some strange reversals
here and there occur, as where white is the colour
significative of grief, or where to turn one’s back on a
person is a sign of reverence. But perhaps few such
reversals are more curious than the custom of the
Garos, in India, who consider any infringement of the
rule that all proposals of marriage must come from
the female side as an insult to the <i>mahári</i> to which
the lady belongs, only to be atoned for by liberal donations
of beer and pigs from the man’s <i>mahári</i> to that of
the ‘proposee.’ More curious, however, than even this
is their marriage ceremony; at which, after the bride
has been bathed in the nearest stream, the wedding
party proceed to the house of the bridegroom, ‘<i>who
pretends to be unwilling and runs away, but is caught</i>
and subjected to a similar ablution, and <i>then taken, in
spite of the resistance and counterfeited grief and lamentations
of his parents, to the bride’s house</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>An exactly analogous custom as regards the bride’s
behaviour at her wedding is sufficiently well known;
and if it has been correctly interpreted as the survival,
in form and symbol, of a system of capturing wives
from a neighbouring tribe, there must have been a
time when among the Garos a husband could only
have been obtained in a similar way. The improbability
of this suggests the possibility of some other
explanation underlying the reluctance, feigned or real,
with which it is common in savage life for a girl to
enter upon the paths of matrimony, and for the show
of resistance with which her friends oppose her departure
with her husband.</p>

<p>In many instances this peculiar feature of primitive
life appears as simply the outcome of feelings and
affections which are the same, howsoever different in
expression, in savage as in civilised lands. The conviction
that there is an utter absence of anything like
love between children and their parents, or between
men and women, in the ruder social communities, is
so strong and has been so often dwelt upon, that in
speculations on this subject there is a tendency and
danger of altogether overlooking the influence of
natural affection in the formation of customs. It
is needful, therefore, to preface the present chapter
with a brief reference to the express statements
of missionaries and travellers; for if it can be shown
that there is such a thing as affection between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
parents and children, the inference is fair that neither
would parents part with their children nor children
leave their parents without mutual regret, when the
children are married.</p>

<p>Of the Fijians, so famous for their cannibalism
and their parenticide, it is declared to be ‘truly touching
to see how parents are attached to their children
and children to their parents.’<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Among the Tongans,
who would sacrifice their children cruelly for the
recovery of the sick, children were ‘taken the utmost
care of.’<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The New Zealanders were not guiltless
of infanticide, yet ‘some of them, and especially
the fathers, seemed fond of their children.’<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The
Papuans of New Guinea manifested ‘respect for the
aged, love for their children, and fidelity to their wives.’<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
In Africa, Mungo Park says of the Mandingoes: ‘The
maternal affection is everywhere conspicuous among
them, and creates a corresponding return of tenderness
in the child.’<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Among the Eastern Ethiopians were
women who lived a wild life in the woods; yet the
testimony is the same: ‘However barbarous these
people be by nature, they yet are not devoid of feeling
for their children; these they rear with nicest care,
and for their provision strive to amass what property
they can.’<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Yoruba ‘children are much beloved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
both parents.’<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Love for their children unites the
greater number of the Bushmen for their whole lives.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
In North America the Thlinkeet Indians ‘treat their
wives and children with much affection and kindness.’<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
Among the Greenlanders, says Cranz, ‘the bonds of
filial and parental love seem stronger than amongst
any other nations.’ Their fondness for their children
is great; parents seldom let them out of their sight,
and mothers often throw themselves in the water to
save a child from drowning. In return ingratitude towards
their aged parents is ‘scarcely ever exemplified
among them.’<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Of the natives of Australia, Sir G.
Grey says that they ‘are always ardently attached to
their children,’ and similar testimony has been borne
to the parental affection even of the Tasmanians.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>But, lest it should be thought that these evidences
are drawn from the higher savagery, let appeal be
made to the case of savages who confessedly belong
to the lowest known types of mankind, the Andaman
Islanders, the Veddahs, and the Fuejians.</p>

<p>In reference to the first it is said that ‘the parents are
fond of their children, and the affection is reciprocal.’<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
The Veddahs are not only ‘kind and constant to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
wives,’ but ‘fond of their children;’<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> whilst Mr. Parker
Snow saw among the Fuejians ‘many instances of
warm love and affection for their children;’<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> so that
if in the sequel we find daughters at their marriage
displaying a real or simulated repugnance to their
fate, the fact need not appear to us of such extreme
mystery as it otherwise might, nor as one in which
natural affection can play no part.</p>

<p>A recent Italian writer on the primitive domestic
state says that ‘la passione viva d’amore che suole
attribuirsi ai popoli primitivi ... é una pura illusione.’<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
But happily for the primitive populations, their
lot is far from being really thus unbrightened by love,
though with them, as with the rest of the world, it is
a frequent cause of wars and quarrels, interfering especially
with the savage custom of infant betrothal,
and leading to elopements in defeat of parental contracts.
It is peculiar to neither sex. A Tahitian girl,
love-stricken, but not encouraged, led her friends, by
her threats of suicide, to persuade the object of her
affections to make her his wife.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The Tongans had a
pretty legend of a young chief, who, having fallen in
love with a maiden already betrothed to a superior,
saved her, when she was condemned to be killed with
the other relations of a rebel, by hiding her in a cavern
he had found, whence they finally effected their joint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
escape to Fiji.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> New Zealand mythology abounds in
love-tales. There is the tale of Hinemoa and Tutanekai,
which begins with stolen glances, and ends in
a nocturnal swim on the part of Hinemoa to the
island, whither the music of her lover guided her.
There is the tale also of Takaranji and Raumahora—of
Takaranji, who, though besieging her father in his
fortress, consented to present both of them with water
in their distress. ‘And Takaranji gazed eagerly at
the young girl, and she too looked eagerly at Takaranji
... and as the warriors of the army of Takaranji
looked on, lo, he had climbed up and was sitting at
the young maiden’s side; and they said among themselves,
“O comrades, our lord Takaranji loves war,
but one would think he likes Raumahora almost as
well.’”<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Nor would it be fair to argue, because in most
savage tribes the hard work of life devolves upon the
women, that therefore there is an entire absence of
affection in savage households, whether polygamous
or otherwise, during their continuance. It is scarcely a
hundred years ago that in Caithness ‘the hard work
was chiefly done, and the burdens borne, by the women;
and if a cottier lost a horse, it was not unusual for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to marry a wife as the cheapest substitute.’<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The
Fuejians, whose condition Captain Weddell felt compelled
to describe as that of the lowest of mankind,
and whose women did all the work, gathering the shellfish,
managing the canoes, and building the wigwams,
are said to have shown ‘a good deal of affection for
their wives,’ and care for their offspring.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Among the
Fijians, who made their women carry all the heavy
loads and do all the field-work, and who remonstrated
with the Tongans for their more humane treatment
of them, not only have widows been known to kill
themselves if their relatives refused to do the duty
which custom laid upon them—namely, of killing
them at their husbands’ burial—but ‘even widowers,
in the depth of their grief, have frequently terminated
their existence when deprived of a dearly beloved
wife.’<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In India, Abor husbands treated their wives
with a consideration that appeared ‘singular in so rude
a race.’<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> In America the lot of a woman was generally
one of hardship; yet, says Schoolcraft, ‘the gentler
affections have a much more extensive and powerful
exercise among the Indians than is generally believed.’<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
Carib husbands are said to have had much
love for their wives, like as it was to a straw fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
except with respect to the first wife they married.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
Of the Thlinkeet Indians, characterised by great
cruelty to prisoners and other marks of much barbarity,
it is said that ‘there are few savage nations in which
the women have greater influence or command greater
respect.’<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> ‘It is one of the fine traits,’ says Schweinfurth
of the cannibal Niam-Niam, ‘that they display
an affection for their wives which is unparalleled
among natives of so low a grade ... a husband will
spare no sacrifice to redeem an imprisoned wife.’<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Though against this evidence there is much of a darker
character to be set, the above instances will suffice to
demonstrate the real existence, the real operation,
among some of the rudest representatives of our species,
of ordinary feelings of love and affection. As in
geology so in ethnology it holds true, that the action of
known existing causes is sufficient to account for much
that is obscure in the past and for all that is strange in
the present.</p>

<p>Having so far cleared the ground as to be justified
in postulating the existence of ordinary feelings of
affection between parents and children, and between
men and women, as <i>veræ causæ</i>, or real forces, even
in the lowest known savage life, let us pass to the inference
that at no time are those feelings more likely
to be called into play than at a time when the daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of a family is about to leave her parents, and perhaps
her clan, to live henceforth with a man whom she may
not even know, or knows only to dislike.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In China,
where on the wedding-day the bride is locked up in a
sedan-chair, and the key and chair consigned to the
bridegroom, who may not see her before that day, a
traveller once witnessed a separation between the
bride and her family. ‘All the family appeared much
affected, particularly the women, who sobbed aloud;
the father shed tears, and the daughter <i>was with
difficulty torn from the embraces of her parents</i> and
placed in the sedan-chair.’<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> It seems more likely in
this case that the reluctance and resistance were real,
than that they were merely the symbols, conventionally
observed, of a system of wife-capture. But in
many instances it is impossible to distinguish a real
from a feigned grief. A witness of the marriage ceremonies
among the Tartars, who describes the bride
and her girl friends as raising piteous lamentations
beforehand, says that the poor girl either was or
appeared to be a most unwilling victim.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Jenkinson, one of the earliest English travellers in
Russia, noticed the same custom there, but thought
it affectation. On the day of marriage the bride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
would in nowise consent to leave the house to go to
church, but would resist, strive, and weep, only suffering
herself to be led there by force, with her face
covered, to hide her simulated grief, and making a
great noise, as though she were sobbing and weeping,
all the way to the scene of her wedding.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> But a
modern French writer ascribes some reality to the
custom, mentioning that traditional songs are still
sung in which the young bride addresses words of
regret and sorrow to her parents in the midst of
her preparations for the nuptial feast.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Before this
last ceremony she is accustomed to go the round
of her village, with a woman who calls for the sympathy
of her hearers for the young girl whose carefree
existence is about to be exchanged for the
troubles and anxieties of married life.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Yet, if in China and Russia, much more among
uncivilized tribes, would the life in prospect for a
bride, unless perchance her wishes coincided with her
parents’ interest, cause her to leave the home of her
youth with something more than those ‘light regrets’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which cause tears to commingle with smiles even
in England. Greenland girls, says Cranz, do nothing
till they are fourteen but sing, dance, and romp about;
but a life of slavery is in store for them as soon as
they are fit for it; ‘while they remain with their
parents they are well off, but from twenty years of
age till death their life is one series of anxieties,
wretchedness, and toil.’<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Marriage is a fate they
would not seek, but cannot avoid. Should they,
however, not oppose it, they must enter upon it with
reluctance, not with alacrity.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing the reason Cranz gives for
this reluctance, because, in so far as modern savages
may be taken to represent primitive life, it proves
the existence, in that condition, of notions, howsoever
they may have arisen, which are exactly analogous to
those we connote by the word ‘modesty.’ When the
two old women, commissioned to negotiate with a girl’s
parents on behalf of a young man, first give a hint of
their purpose by praise of him and of his family, ‘the
damsel directly falls into the greatest apparent consternation
and runs out of doors, tearing her bunch of
hair; for <i>single women always affect the utmost bashfulness
and aversion to any proposal of marriage, lest
they should lose their reputation for modesty</i>, though
their destined husbands be previously well assured
of their acquiescence.’<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Not, indeed, that the reluctance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
is always feigned, for sometimes the name of her
proposed husband causes her to swoon, to elope to a
desert place, or to effectually free herself from further
addresses, by cutting off her hair in token of grief.
Should, however, her parents consent to the match,
the usual course is for the old women to go in search
of her, ‘and <i>drag her forcibly into the suitor’s house</i>,
where she sits for several days quite disconsolate,
with dishevelled hair, and refuses nourishment.
When friendly exhortations are unavailing she is
compelled by force, and even blows, to receive her
husband.’</p>

<p>In Greenland, then, as in China, the form of
capture resolves itself either into a most unequivocal
reluctance to leave home or to a reluctance so to do
feigned from feelings of bashfulness. Nor about this
bashfulness does it appear that Cranz was in error, for
Egede agrees substantially with him, telling how the
bridegroom, when he has obtained her parents’ and
relations’ consent, sends some old women <i>to carry
away the bride by force</i>; ‘for though she ever so much
approves of the match, yet <i>out of modesty she must
make as if it went against the grain, and as if she were
much ruffled at it; else she will be blamed and get an
ill name</i>.’ When brought to his hut, therefore, she sits
in a corner with dishevelled hair, ‘covering her face,
being bashful and ashamed.’ For ‘<i>a new-married
woman is ashamed of having changed her condition for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a married state</i>;’<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and this feeling occurs again plainly
in South-Eastern Russia, where, on the eve of marriage,
the bride goes round the village, throwing herself
on her knees before the head of each house and
<i>begging his pardon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>This last statement of Egede is most important,
since it proves the existence of feelings which seem
really to contain the keynote of the symbol of capture,
however slight the reasons for suspecting their
presence in particular cases. The sentiment prevalent
in Greenland has also been noticed among the Tartars,
for an authentic witness writes, ‘that if one tells
a Tartar girl that it is said she is about to be married,
she runs immediately out of the room and will never
speak to a stranger on that subject.’<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> It has been
justly observed that it is unlikely feminine delicacy
should diminish with civilization. But the principle
<i>impuris omnia impura</i> will meet the difficulty. The
Aleutian Islander, says a Russian writer, ‘knows nothing
of what civilized nations call modesty. He has
his own ideas of what is modest and proper, while we
should consider them foolish.’<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> For, addicted though
he is to the worst vices of the Northern nations, he will
yet blush to address his wife or ask her for anything
in the presence of strangers, and will be bashful if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he be caught doing anything unusual, as, for instance,
buying or selling directly for himself without
the agency of an intermediary.</p>

<p>Characteristic as it is of savages to express all the
feelings they share with us with an energy intensified
a hundredfold, as is shown abundantly in our different
manner of grieving for the dead, it is not surprising
if we find their feelings of the kind in question
display themselves in extraordinary and often ludicrous
rules of social intercourse. The same rule, that an
Aleutian husband and wife might not be seen speaking
together, led Kolbe to think that no such thing as affection
existed among the Hottentots. But this was
simply for the same reason that prohibited the Hottentot
wife from ever setting foot in her husband’s apartment
in the hut, or the latter from ever entering hers
except by stealth.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Among the Yorubas a woman
betrothed by her parents is so far a wife that prematrimonial
unfaithfulness is accounted adultery;
‘yet conventional modesty forbids her to speak to her
husband, or even to see him, if it can be avoided.’<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> A
minority of the Afghan tribes are careful to keep up a
similar reserve between the time of betrothal and marriage,
so that, as among the warlike Eusofyzes, no man
can see his wife till the completion of the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Among the Mongols not only may bride
and bridegroom not see each other within the same
period, but the bride is not allowed to see his parents.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
In Russia it was once a disgrace for a young man to
propose directly to a lady, and between the day of
settling the dowry with her parents and the day of
marriage he was strictly forbidden the house of his
betrothed.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> But many tribes continue such reserve
even after marriage. A Circassian bridegroom must
not see his wife or live with her without the greatest
mystery: ‘this reserve continues during life. A Circassian
will sometimes permit a stranger to see his
wife, but he must not accompany him.’<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> In parts of
Fiji which are still unmodified by Christian teaching
it is ‘quite contrary to ideas of delicacy that a man ever
remains under the same roof with his wife or wives at
night.’ If they wish to meet, they must appoint a
secret rendezvous.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> And a similar law of social decorum
prevails, or prevailed, among the Spartans,
Lycians, Turcomans, and some tribes of America,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
though the processes of thought which led to such customs
lie lost, perhaps hopelessly, behind the darkness
of a thousand ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The custom, again, of deserting a husband and
returning home for a longer or shorter period, as
found among the Votyaks of Russia and the Mezeyne
Arabs, may possibly be traced to feelings of the same
description, for we read that among the Hos, ‘after
remaining with her husband for three days only, it is
<i>the correct thing for the wife to run away</i> from him
and tell all her friends that she loves him not, and
will see him no more;’ it is also <i>correct</i> for the husband
to manifest great anxiety for his loss, and diligently
to seek his wife, and ‘when he finds her <i>he
carries her off by main force</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> This second show
of resistance, customary also among the Votyaks,
seems difficult to explain as a traditional symbol of
a system of capture.</p>

<p>It is possible that in similar primitive ideas originated
the curious restrictions on the intercourse between
a man and his mother-in-law, or between a
woman and her father-in-law. On the theory that
these are remnants of the real anger shown by parents
when capture was real, it is not easy to account for
the fact that in Fiji the restriction as to eating or
speaking together existed not only between parents
and children-in-law, or brothers and sisters-in-law, but
between brothers and sisters of the same family, and
also between first cousins.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> In Suffolk ‘it is (or was)
very remarkable that neither father nor mother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
bride or bridegroom come with them to church’ at the
weddings of agricultural labourers; and it is said that
at Russian weddings also the parents are forbidden
to be present, though the priest sometimes waives
the prohibition in favour of persons of the higher
classes.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>There is, therefore, no <i>à priori</i> inconceivability
against the theory that kicking and screaming at
weddings, where they do not arise from genuine reluctance,
are really a tribute to conventional propriety;
that, at the marriages of the uncivilized, just as at
their burials, shrieks and violence take the place of
tears, and a vigorous struggle argues a modest deportment.
The evidence of quite independent eye-witnesses
confirms this interpretation. The Thlinkeet
Indian, on his wedding-day, goes to the bride’s house
and sits with his back to her door. All her relations
then ‘raise a song, to allure the coy bride out of the
corner where she has been sitting;’ after which she
goes to sit by her husband’s side; but ‘<i>all this time
she must keep her head bowed down</i>,’ nor is she allowed
to take part in the festivities of the day.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Atkinson, who was witness of the first visit of a
Kirghiz bridegroom to his wife, declares that the
latter could only be persuaded by the pressure of her
female relations to see him at all; ‘after a display of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
much coyness she consented, and was led by her
friends to his dwelling.’<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>In Kamschatka the original etiquette was for
women to cover their faces with some kind of veil
when they went out, and if they met any man on the
road whom they could not avoid, to stand with their
backs to him until he had passed. They would also,
if a stranger entered their huts, turn their face to the
wall or else hide behind a curtain of nettles.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Kamschatka,
however, being the last place where one would
have looked for such prudery, it is possible that the
feelings of the Greenlanders were also operative in
the marriage customs of the Kamschadals. These
were rather extraordinary, the form of capture being
anything but a mere symbol for an aspirant to matrimony.
Such an one, having looked for a bride in some
neighbouring village (seldom in his own), would offer
his services to the parent for a fixed term, and after some
time would ask for leave to seize the daughter for his
bride. This obtained, he would seek to find her alone or
ill-attended, the marriage being complete on his tearing
from her some of the coats, fish-nets, and straps
with which from the day of proposal she was constantly
enveloped. This was never an easy matter, for she
was never left alone a single instant, her mother and
a number of old women accompanying her everywhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sleeping with her, and never losing her out of
sight upon any pretext whatever. Any attempt to execute
his task entailed upon the suitor such kicking,
hair-pulling, and face-scratching, at the hands of this
female body-guard, that sometimes a year or more
would elapse before he was entitled to call himself a
husband; nay, there is record of one pertinacious
bachelor who found himself at the end of seven years,
in consequence of such treatment, not a husband,
but a cripple. If he were disheartened by repeated
failures he incurred great disgrace and lost all claim
to the alliance; and if the bride continued obdurate
from real dislike, he was ultimately expelled from the
village.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> But, however well-disposed towards him
she might be, she had always to simulate refusal as a
point of honour, and proof was always required ‘that
she was taken by surprise and made fruitless efforts
to defend herself.’<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The Bushmen, again, generally betroth their
daughters as children without consulting them; but
should a girl grow up unbetrothed her consent to be
married is as necessary as that of her parents to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
lover’s suit, ‘and on this occasion his attentions are
received with an affectation of great alarm and disinclination
on her part.’<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>If, then, Greenlanders, Kamschadals, Thlinkeet
Indians, and even Bushmen, carry their notions of
propriety to the extent asserted by eye-witnesses, it
is scarcely surprising to find very similar rules of
etiquette among the more advanced Zulus of Africa
or Bedouins of Arabia in their wedding ceremonials;
especially when we are told that in some parts Bedouin
women sit down and turn their backs to any
man they cannot avoid on the road, and refuse to
take anything from the hands of a stranger.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> ‘The
principal idea of a Kaffir wedding seems to be to
show the great unwillingness of the girl to be transformed
into a wife,’ for which reason a Zulu wife
simulates several attempts to escape.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Both the
Arabs of Sinai and the Aenezes enact the form of
capture to the greatest perfection; among the latter
‘the bashful girl’ runs from the tent of one friend
to another till she is caught at last, whilst among the
former she acquires permanent repute in proportion
to her struggles of resistance. And if a Sinai Arab
marries a bride belonging to a distant tribe, she is
placed on a camel and led to her husband’s camp
escorted by women: during which procession ‘<i>decency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
obliges her to cry and sob most bitterly</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Also, among
the modern Egyptians, ‘if the bridegroom is young,
one of his friends has to <i>carry him</i> part of the way to
the hareem, to <i>show his bashfulness</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> So that where
the carrying of the bride or bridegroom is not merely
due to the same feelings that caused our own ancestors
to add solemnity to their weddings by such
singular sights as blue postilions, it appears in many
cases to be nothing more than a prudish way of saying,
that matrimony is and ought to be an estate
forced upon reluctant victims, not entered upon by
voluntary agents. The early Christian Church said
the same; but where the saint and the savage meet
in sentiment they differ in expression.</p>

<p>Were it not for some of the concomitant and incidental
signs, the bowed or veiled head, the dishevelled
hair, it might be said that the positive statements of
Cranz, Egede, Burchell, and other writers arose from
malobservation or from pure mistake. This objection,
therefore, is of little avail; and however difficult it
may be to account for the presence of such sentiments
among tribes of so rude a type as the Esquimaux, the
Kamschadals, and the Bushmen, the fact remains,
that in the cases above cited the ‘form of capture’ is
explicable as having its origin in primitive conceptions
of what is due to delicacy; as being, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the original expression of them in the language of
pantomime so common to savages.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> And the presence
of such feelings of delicacy may be often suspected,
even where they are not directly mentioned,
in the ceremony of capture; as, for instance, in the
African kingdom of Futa, where the form of capture
prevails in the usual way, but where we have the indirect
evidence that for months after marriage the
bride never stirs abroad without a veil, and that Futa
wives are ‘so bashful that they never permit their husbands
to see them unveiled for three years after their
marriage.’<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>There is, however, no reason to press this explanation
too far, nor to account it the only efficient cause.
Quite as potent, and perhaps a more natural one, is
dislike and disinclination on the part of the bride,
which compels the bridegroom to resort to force. The
conditions of savage life are a sufficient explanation of
this, irrespective of any old custom of capturing wives
out of a tribe by reason of a prejudice against marrying
within it. A man proposes personally or mediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to the parents or relations of the woman he fancies
for a wife; if they consent to accept him as a son-in-law
and they agree as to a price, there is a reserved
stipulation on the part of the vendor: ‘<i>If you can get
her.</i>’ In Tartary, in the thirteenth century, after such
a bargain, the daughter would flee to one of her kinsfolk
to hide; the father would say to the husband,
‘My daughter is yours; take her wheresoever you can
find her.’ The suitor, seeking with his friends till he
found her, would then take her by force and carry her
home.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Here the girl’s reluctance is not so much
feigned as overridden, and is only so far formal in that
it is entirely disregarded. Often it is no mere ceremony
on her part, but a natural and genuine protest—a
protest against being treated as a chattel, not as
an individual—but a protest which, opposed as it is to
parental persuasion and marital force, tends, as far as
the husband is concerned, to pass into the region of
the merest ceremony.</p>

<p>A few instances will suffice to illustrate the co-operation
of dislike and force in savage matrimony.
In some Californian tribes the consent of the girl
is necessary, although ‘if she violently opposes the
match she is seldom compelled to marry or to be sold.’
Among the Neshenam tribe of the same people ‘the
girl has no voice whatever in the matter, and resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
on her part merely occasions brute force to be used
by her purchaser.’<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> So in the Utah country, where
‘families and tribes living at peace would steal each
others’ wives and children and sell them as slaves,’ a
wife is usually bought of her parents; but should
she refuse, ‘the warrior collects his friends, <i>carries off
the recusant fair</i>,’ and thus espouses her.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> So among
the Navajoes ‘the consent of the father is absolute,
and the one so purchased assents <i>or is taken away by
force</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> It is the same with the Horse Indians of
Patagonia. There, as elsewhere, it is common for a
cacique to have several wives, and poor men only
one, marriages being ‘made by sale more frequently
than by mutual agreement.’ The price is often
high, and girls are betrothed without their knowledge
in infancy and married without their consent
at maturity. But ‘if a girl dislikes a match
made for her she resists; and although <i>dragged
forcibly to the tent of her lawful owner</i>, plagues him so
much by her contumacy that he at last turns her
away, and sells her to the person on whom she has
fixed her affections.’<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> In Africa, Yorubas, Mandingoes,
and Koossa Kafirs follow the custom of infant betrothal
(and it is worth notice as being quite in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with the theory that kinship was originally traced
through mothers, that Yoruba, Mandingo, and Loango
Africans, and some Esquimaux tribes, regard the
mother’s consent only as necessary to an engagement);<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
but sometimes a Yoruba girl, when the time
comes for her to fulfil her mother’s engagement,
preferring some other than the intended husband,
absolutely refuses to co-operate. ‘Then she is either
teased and worried into submission or the husband
agrees to receive back her dowry and release her.’<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
A Mandingo girl must either marry a suitor chosen
for her or remain ever afterwards unmarried. Should
she refuse, the lover is authorized by the parents ‘by
the laws of the country to seize on the girl as his
slave.’<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> If a Koossa girl, bound by the contract of her
parents, ‘makes any attempt at resisting the union,
corporal punishment is even resorted to, in order to
compel her submission.’<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that resistance on the part
of the bride in many cases procures her ultimate release,
so that her wishes in the matter are always an
element to be considered. In all contracts of marriage,
to which she is seldom a party, there is accordingly,
in the nature of things, an implied covenant that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
daughter shall be so far allowed a voice in the matter
that if she can make good her resistance she shall not
become the property of the intending purchaser. The
frequency with which it must have occurred that a
girl would defeat a match she disliked by flight, elopement,
or resistance, would tend to create a sort of
common law right, for all daughters sold in marriage
to a certain ‘run’ for their independence;<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and the
amusement naturally connected with the exercise of
such a right would help to preserve the custom in a
modified form; so that, however slight in some cases
might be the modesty of the bride or her dislike of
her suitor, her friends, if only for the sport of the thing,
would gladly enact the fiction of an outrage to be
resented, of a woman to be defended. In all the interesting
cases of the form of capture cited by Sir
John Lubbock it appears that in eight (that is, among
the Mantras, the Kalmucks, the Fuejians, the Fijians,
the New Zealanders, the Papuans of New Guinea, the
Philippine Islanders, and the African Kafirs and
Futas), the ceremony affords the bride a chance of an
effectual escape from a match she dislikes. Should
she fly, should she hide successfully, or should her
friends defend her successfully, the contract between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
her parents and suitor becomes null and void; or sometimes,
as among the Zulus and Bassutos, the price for
her is raised.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> And it is remarkable with what precision
the rules of the chase have been elaborated in
many instances; as by the Oleepas of Central California,
among whom, if a bride is found twice out of
three times, she is legally the seeker’s; and the bridegroom,
if he fails the first time, is allowed a second
and final attempt a few weeks later. ‘The simple
result is, that if the girl likes him she hides where she
is easily found; but if she disapproves of the match a
dozen Indians cannot find her.’<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Other feelings would also be present to sustain the
pretence of wife-capture. For the savage parent, in
parting with his daughter for a favourable settlement,
does not act from gratuitous cruelty; he provides for
her future as best he can, sometimes in accordance
with her wishes, sometimes against them. As a rule
marriage for her is a change for the worse; but if
she does not dislike the bridegroom to the extent of
availing herself of her prescriptive and real chance of
escape, her natural feelings for her parents and relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
would make it incumbent on her at least to affect
a dutiful regret at leaving them (in cases where she
does), by a half-bashful, half-serious resistance. It
would be difficult to find a case of capture, whether
in form or in fact, which is not readily explicable as
simply the outcome of the natural affections and their
protest against so artificial an arrangement as marriage
by purchase; for with marriage by purchase the form
of capture always co-exists, so that capture was not
necessarily an earlier mode of marriage than that by
purchase or agreement. The mock fights between
the party of the bride and that of the bridegroom
among so many Indian tribes;<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> the dances, lasting
several days, during which it is the business of the
squaws to keep the bridegroom at a distance from his
bride, among the Tucanas of South America;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> the similar
duty which devolves on the matrons of the tribe
at Sumatran weddings;<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> the mock skirmishes at Arab
weddings, and the efforts of the negresses to keep the
bridegroom away from the camel of the bride;<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> these
are surely more intelligible, as arising from the rude
ideas and customs of savage life, than as being survivals,
artificially preserved, of a time when the bride
was really fought for or stolen; and if such explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
is sufficient, should it not logically be admitted
before resorting to the hypothesis of a practice whose
very existence is rather an inference from such ceremonies
than a cause observable in actual operation?</p>

<p>To pass to a third and quite distinct class of marriages
by capture, in which the essential element is
not maidenly bashfulness nor real repugnance, but the
voluntary elopement of a girl with her lover, in defeat
of a prior contract of betrothal. The large part which
questions of profit and property play in savage betrothals
can never be lost sight of, in estimating the
causes of real wife abduction, either within or without
the tribe. The primary conception of a daughter is a
saleable possession, a source of profit, to her clan in
marketings with other clans or to her parents in their
bargains in her own clan. This fact alone militates
against the supposition of the wide prevalence of
female infanticide in primitive communities, the prejudice
being rather in favour of killing the boys than
the girls; not solely for the use of the latter as slaves
and labourers, but for the price which even among
Fuejians or Bushmen is payable in some form or
another for their companionship as wives. Abiponian
mothers spared their girls oftener than their boys,
because their sons when grown up would want wherewithal
to purchase a wife, and so tend to impoverish
them; whilst their daughters would bring them in
money by their sale in that capacity.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> To raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
price by limiting the supply was also the reason why
the Guanas of America preferred to bury their girls
alive rather than their boys.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>From this view of daughters as saleable commodities
comes polygamy for the rich, polyandry, or
illicit elopement, for the poor. Among the Hos of
India so high at one time was the price in cattle placed
by parents on their daughters that the large number of
adult unmarried girls became a ‘very peculiar feature
in the social state of every considerable village of the
Kohlán.’ What, then, was the result? That ‘young
men counteracted the machinations of avaricious
parents against the course of true love by <i>forcibly
carrying off the girl</i>,’ thus avoiding extortion by running
away with her. The parents in such cases had
to submit to terms proposed by arbitrators; but at
last wife-abduction became so common that it could
only be checked by the limitation by general consent
of the number of cattle payable at marriage.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>‘A very singular scene,’ it is said, ‘may sometimes
be noticed in the markets of Singbhoom. A
young man suddenly makes a pounce on a girl and
carries her off bodily, his friends covering the retreat
(like a group from the picture of the Rape of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Sabines). This is generally a <i>summary method of
surmounting the obstacles that cruel parents may have
placed in the lovers’ path</i>; but though it is sometimes
done in anticipation of the favourable inclination of
the girl herself, and in spite of her struggles and
tears, no disinterested person interferes, and the girls,
late companions of the abducted maiden, often applaud
the exploit.’<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>In Afghanistan the pecuniary value of women has
given rise to the curious custom of assessing part of
the fines in criminal cases in a certain number of
young women payable in atonement as wives to the
plaintiff or to his relations from the family of the
defendant. Thus murder is or was expiated by the
payment of twelve young women; the cutting off a
hand, an ear, or a nose by that of six; the breaking
of a tooth by that of three; a wound above the forehead
by that of one. This was the logical result of
the state of thought which produces wife-purchase;
but there was also another. For in the country parts,
where matches generally begin in attachment, an
enterprising lover may avoid the obstacle of parental
consent by a form of capture, which has a legal
sanction, though it does not exempt the captor from
subsequent payment. This consists in a man’s ‘seizing
an opportunity of cutting off a lock of her (the woman’s)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
hair, snatching away her veil, or throwing a sheet
over her, and claiming her as his affianced wife.’ But
the most common expedient is an ordinary elopement;
though this is held an outrage to a family
equivalent to the murder of one of its members; and
being pursued with the same rancour, is often the
cause of long and bloody wars between the clans;
for as the fugitive couple are never refused an
asylum, ‘the seduction of a woman of one Oolooss
by a man of another, or a man’s eloping with a girl
of his own Oolooss,’ is the commonest cause of
feuds between the clans.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Love attachments, in defeat of parental plans,
lead to very similar results in Bokhara. For ‘the
daughter of a Turcoman has a high price; and the
swain, in despair of making a legitimate purchase,
seizes his sweetheart, seats her behind him on the
same horse, and gallops off to the nearest camp,
where the parties are united, and separation is impossible.
The parents and relations pursue the lovers,
and the marriage is adjusted by an intermarriage
with some female relation of the bridegroom, while
he himself becomes bound to pay so many camels and
horses as the price of his bride.’<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>There is, therefore, evidence to justify the theory
that the form of capture may often be explained as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
an attempt to regulate by law the danger to a tribe
arising from too frequent elopements, naturally resulting
from the abuse of the parental right of selling
daughters. In Sumatra the defeat of matrimonial
plans by an elopement with a preferred suitor is so
common as to be sanctioned and regulated by law,
being known as the system of marriage by <i>telari
gadis</i>; the father in such a case having to pay the
fine to which he would have been liable for bestowing
his daughter after engagement to another suitor, and
only being allowed to recover her, if he catches her in
immediate pursuit. ‘When the parties,’ says Mr.
McLennan, ‘cannot agree about the price, nothing is
more common among the Kalmucks, Kirghiz, Nogais,
and Circassians than to carry the lady off by actual
force of arms. The wooer having once got the lady
into his <i>yurt</i>, she is his wife by the law, and peace is
established by her relations coming to terms as to the
price.’ So too in England, elopements have often
preceded and promoted more definite marriage settlements,
or, with some slight observances, have stood
legally as a substitute for them.</p>

<p>Considering, then, that the affections and wishes
do not count for nothing even among savages;
considering that among savages, more even than in
civilized life, marriage is a question of property and
of means, so that, whilst the richest members of a
tribe almost universally have several wives, it is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
all that the poorer can do to get a wife at all, we
have a set of circumstances leading naturally sometimes
to voluntary elopement on the part of the girl,
in defeat of her parents, sometimes to literal wife-capture
by a man otherwise unable to become a
husband. This condition of things leads of necessity
to polyandry and wife-robbery. In some Australian
tribes, owing to a disproportion between the sexes,
many men have to steal a wife from a neighbouring
horde. But it is not their normal recognized mode
of marriage. On the contrary, their laws on this
subject are somewhat elaborate; and as it appears
that before that state of society in which a daughter
belongs to her father there is one in which she
belongs to her mother, and perhaps a still prior state
in which she belongs to her tribe, so from their birth
Australian girls are appropriated to certain males of
the tribe, nor can the parents annul the obligation.
If the male dies the mother may then bestow her
daughter on whom she will, for by the death of her
legal owner the girl becomes to some extent the
property of her relations, who have certain claims on
her services for the procurement of food. But to the
surrender of a girl by her mother the full consent of
the whole tribe is necessary; and if, as sometimes
happens, ‘the young people, listening rather to the
dictates of inclination than those of law, improvise
a marriage by absconding together,’ they incur the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
fatal enmity of the whole tribe.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> According to Bonwick,
a Tasmanian or Australian woman was never
stolen contrary to her expectations or wishes. Only if
all other schemes to have her own way failed, would a
girl face the penalty of having ‘the spear of the disappointed,
the spear of the guardian, and the spears of the
tribe’ thrown at her, for her breach of tribal law.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>The conception of the daughters of a clan as its
property, as a source of contingent wealth to it, of
additional income to it in sheep, dogs, or whatever
the medium of exchange, tends to keep up in many
cases that prohibition to marry in the same clan or
subdivision of a tribe which is known as exogamy.
Among the Hindu Kafirs it is said to be uncertain
why a man may not sell his girls to his own tribe,
and why a man must always buy his wife from
another; but it is certain that for this reason the
more girls a man has born to him the better he is
pleased and the richer his tribe becomes.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> A Khond
father distributes among the heads of the families,
belonging to his branch of a tribe, the sum raised on
behalf of a son-in-law by subscription from the son-in-law’s
branch. But, supposing a great inequality of
wealth to arise between different clans, originally
united by profitable intermarriages, it might become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
more profitable to sell within the clan than outside it,
so that the same motives of interest which, under some
circumstances, would tend to encourage exogamy
would under others lead to the opposite principle, a
rich bridegroom of the same clan being preferable to
a poor one of another, whether the gain accrued to a
girl’s parents or her clan. It is, perhaps, for this reason
that a Hindu Kooch incurs a fine if he marries a
woman of another clan, becoming a bondsman till his
wife redeems him; that is, till she pays back to his clan
or its chief what the bridegroom, by purchasing her,
has alienated from the use of the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> On the other
hand, the reason given by the Khonds for marrying
women from distant places was, that they gave much
smaller sums than for women of their own tribe.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Exogamy and endogamy would thus co-exist, as
the customs of tribes that have attained to a more
or less complete recognition of the rights of property,
and are so far advanced as to be capable
of preserving complex rules of social organization.
Marriages, therefore, under either <i>régime</i> are matters
generally of friendly settlement, of ordinary contract;
and where such arrangements are defeated by the
perversity of the principal parties—namely, the bride
or the bridegroom—what more natural than the
device of giving legal sanction to an elopement by
settling a subsequent compensation with the parent?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The custom of exogamy is so widely spread over
the world that its origin must be sought in conditions
as prevalent as itself, and it is possible that it arose
out of the same condition which certainly sustains it
and is co-extensive with itself, namely, from the
marketable position of women. That female infanticide
should have led to it is improbable, not only from
the comparative rarity of the practice among the
<i>rudest</i> tribes, but from the negative instance of the
Todas, a wild Indian hill-tribe, who, notwithstanding
the scarcity of their women, and a scarcity actually
attributed to former female infanticide, ‘never contract
marriage with the other tribes, though living
together on most friendly terms.’<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Judging <i>à priori</i>,
we should expect to find as of earlier date a prejudice
in favour of tribal exclusiveness, of strict endogamy.
The idea of the Abors that marriage out of the clan is
a sin only to be washed out by sacrifice—a sin so
great as to cause war among the elements, and even
obscuration of the sun and moon—has a more archaic
appearance than the contrary principle; and the
confinement of marriages to a few families of known
purity of descent is characteristic of some of the
lowest Hindu castes.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The prejudice against foreign
women is so strong that there is often a tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
regard female prisoners of war as merely slaves, as
not of the same rank with the real wives of their
captors. Thus, ‘though the different tribes of the
Aht nation are frequently at war with one another,
women are not captured from other tribes for
marriage, but only to be kept as slaves. The idea of
slavery connected with capture is so common that a
free-born Aht would hesitate to marry a woman
taken in war, whatever her rank had been in her own
tribe.’<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The Caribs, too, if they kept female prisoners
as wives always regarded them as slaves, as standing
on a lower level than their legitimate wives.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Leaving, however, the obscure problem of the origin
of exogamy, there is a point of view from which both
that and endogamy are one. For exogamy as regards
the subdivisions of a tribe is endogamy as regards
the tribe itself, tending in fact to preserve tribal
unity and to check an indefinite divergency of interests
and dialects. For example, where a Hindoo caste or
tribe is composed of several Gotrams, no person of
whom may marry an individual of the same Gotram,
it is evident that the unity of the tribe is actually
sustained by the exogamy of its constituent parts.
Such a custom therefore, howsoever originated, would,
as serviceable in maintaining tribal unity against
hostile neighbouring people, tend to survive from
motives of common expediency, from its adaptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to the interests of peace; a beneficial result of the
system which in Mr. Bancroft’s account of the Thlinkeet
and Kutchin Indians clearly appears.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The
Thlinkeets are nationally divided into two great clans,
under the totems of the Wolf and the Raven, and
these two are again subdivided into numerous sub-totems.
‘In this clanship some singular social facts
present themselves. People are at once thrust widely
apart and yet drawn together. Tribes of the same
clan may not war on each other, but at the same time
members of the same clan may not marry each other.
Thus the young Wolf warrior must seek his mate
among the Ravens.... <i>Obviously this singular
social fancy tends greatly to keep the various tribes of
the nation at peace.</i>’ The Kutchins, again, are divided
into three castes, resident in different territories, no
two persons of the same caste being allowed to marry.
‘<i>This system operates strongly against war between
the tribes</i>, as in war it is caste against caste, not
tribe against tribe. As the father is never of the
same caste as the son, who receives clanship from the
mother, there can never be international war without
ranging fathers and sons against each other.’ So
among the Khonds, who punish intermarriage between
persons of the same tribe with death, the intervention
of the women was always essential to peace,
as they were neutral between the tribe of their fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and that of their husbands.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> But it is difficult to
think that, if hostile relations between exogamous
clans became permanent, the several clans would still
insist on exogamous marriages as the only marriages
legally valid, and consequently regard the use of force
or fraud as the only legitimate title to a wife.</p>

<p>It seems indeed certain that wherever the rule of
exogamy exists it may be analysed into a prohibition
to marry within the divisions of a larger group; that
larger group being consciously recognised as uniting
the divergent families by resemblance of dialect,
common political ties, or a traditional common
descent. The Kalmucks, for instance, call themselves
‘the peculiar people,’ or ‘the four allies,’ and any
danger of their national dissolution is obviously
diminished by the very fact of the exogamy of their
four clans. The Circassians, whose constituent brotherhoods
are exogamous, by the occasional assemblies of
the brotherhoods for the settlement of disputes, show
a consciousness of their political unity, which by the
exogamy of the brotherhoods they help to maintain.
The Hindu castes preserve their mutual exclusiveness
by the very fact of compelling all their constituent
families to intermingle in marriage, and so preventing
any one of them from dissolving the common relationship
by absolute separation or independent growth.
So that exogamy rather sustains than prevents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
system of marriages within the same stock, and is a
mark of a higher conception of social organisation,
when people have learned to classify themselves with
respect to their neighbours, when tribal and personal
property is well established, and when, consequently,
marriages between the groups can be effected by
purchase better than by violence. Exogamy therefore
as the product or concomitant of a somewhat
advanced state of thought, not of utter barbarism,
would never make marriages by capture a necessity
of existence; but, if it did, it would argue so much
culture in a tribe capable of maintaining such rules, as
would equally justify us in ascribing to them moral
feelings, not less advanced and refined than those
involved in their adherence to so restrictive a political
system.</p>

<p>South Australia supplies a typical illustration of
the confusion relating to intertribal marriages which
arises from the vague use of the word <i>tribe</i>. For
wherever there is reason to suspect that the word clan
or family should stand for the word tribe, it is probable
that the exogamy predicated of the tribe only
prevails between its constituent elements; in other
words, that it is only, as among the Kalmucks, Circassians,
or Hindu castes, an extended form of the
principle of endogamy. Thus, Collins, describing
wife-capture in New South Wales, says that ‘it is
believed’ the women so taken are always selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
from women of a different tribe from that of the
males, and from one with whom they are at enmity;
that as wives ‘they are incorporated into the tribes
to which their husbands belong, and but seldom quit
them for others.’ But he uses the word tribe as convertible
with the word family, as when he speaks of
the natives near Port Jackson being distributed into
families, each under the government of its own head,
and deriving its name from its place of residence.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
And the statements of Captain Hunter, a previous
writer, that the natives are associated ‘in tribes of
many families together,’ living apparently without
a fixed residence; that ‘the tribe takes its name,
from the place of their general residence;’ and that,
the different families wander in different directions
for food, but unite on occasion of disputes with another
tribe, make it still more probable that when
Collins spoke of different tribes he meant merely,
different families, or groups, which with all their
separate wanderings united sometimes in cases of
common danger. So when Captain Hunter himself
says that ‘there is some reason to suppose that most
of their wives are taken by force from the tribes with
whom they are at variance, as the females bear no
proportion to the males,’ we may take it that by tribes
he means families, and families who recognise their
community of blood when a really different tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
provokes their hostility by assembling as a tribe
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Mr. Stanbridge, who spent eighteen
years in the wilds of Victoria, corroborates this view;
for, according to him, each tribe has its own boundaries,
the land of which is parcelled out amongst
families and carefully transmitted by direct descent;
these boundaries being so sacredly maintained that
the member of no one family will venture on the
lands of a neighbouring one without invitation. The
several families (or tribes) unite for mutual purposes
under a chief. The women often, but not always,
marry into distant tribes; they are generally betrothed
in their infancy, but if they grow up unbetrothed the
father’s consent must be solicited; failing him, the
brother’s; then the uncle’s; and last of all that of a
council or a chief of a tribe.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> That force was ever
the normal method by which marriages were effected
in Australia, there is no proof; that, on the contrary,
mutual likings often set the law, is proved by the
story of the native captive girl, who, after living among
the colonists for some time, expressed a desire to go
away and be married to a young native of her acquaintance;
albeit that she left him after three days, returning
sadly beaten and jealous of the other wife.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite distinct, again, either from the real or pretended
reluctance of a savage girl to become a bride,
or from the custom of forcing an avaricious parent to
a settlement by the shorter process of taking first and
paying afterwards, is the custom of stealing women
from the same or a neighbouring clan, a custom which
prevailed widely in Ireland and Scotland in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, and which in the
latter country has been ‘glorified in a whole literature
of songs and ballads.’<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>That polygamy and wife-purchase and artificial
tribal regulations often lead to such a result cannot
be denied; but that it is anywhere a system, sustained
by prejudices, whencesoever derived, seems completely
unwarranted by the evidence hitherto collected. The
Coinmen of Patagonia, who made annual inroads on
the Tekeenica tribe, killing the men and carrying off
not only the women but the children, dogs, arrows,
spears, and canoes, seem to have been actuated rather
by the ordinary motives of freebooters (by such
motives, for instance, as induced our early convict
settlers in Tasmania to set off with their bullock-chains
to make captives of the native women<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>) than
by any scruples of marrying relations at home. Carib
wives taken in war were accounted slaves; and so far
were the Caribs from being dependent on aggression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
for their wives, that before their customs were modified
by acquaintance with the Christians their only legitimate
wives were their cousins.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> If a man had no
cousin to marry, or put off doing so till it was too
late, he might then marry some non-relative, with the
consent of her parents. At the festival that followed
a successful war the parents vied with one another
in offering their daughters as wives to those who
were praised by their captains as having fought with
bravery. The Caribs of the continent differed from
those of the islands in that men and women spoke
the same language, not having corrupted their native
tongue by marriages with foreign women.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> According
to Humboldt, the language of the Caribs of the
continent was the same, from the source of the Rio
Branco to the steppes of Cumana; and the pride
of race which led them to withdraw from every other
people, and was the cause of the failure of all missionary
efforts that tried to combine them with villages
containing people of another nation and speaking
another idiom, would surely have militated against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
making exogamy a preliminary condition of matrimony.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
Humboldt, indeed, says that polygamy was
more extensively practised by the Caribs and other
nations that ‘preserved the custom of carrying off
young girls from the neighbouring tribe;’ but it
would be contrary to all previous accounts of the
people to suppose these were their only wives, such a
supplement to domestic felicity being everywhere the
common reward, though seldom the chief object, of
successful war. The curious difference in the language
of the men and of the women found to exist among
the Caribs of the West Indian Archipelago, and
attributed by tradition to the conquest of a former
people on the islands, whose wives the conquerors
appropriated, has perhaps been rather exaggerated, for
in a list of 488 words and phrases employed by both
sexes, in only 36 is there any difference marked
between the language of the men and that of the
women. The origin of the difference may be doubted,
as there were also words and phrases used by the
old men of the people which the younger ones might
not use; and there was a war-dialect of which neither
women, girls, or boys had any knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> But
probably the difference arose from a custom similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to that of the Zulus, which makes it unlawful for a
woman to use any word containing the sound of her
father-in-law’s name or of the names of her husband’s
male relations. ‘Whenever the emphatic syllable of
either of their proper names occurs in any other word,
she must avoid it, by either substituting an entirely new
word, or at least another syllable in its place. Hence
<i>this custom has given rise to an almost distinct language
among the women</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> In consequence of this <i>Hlonipa</i>
custom, according to another witness, ‘<i>the language at
this present time almost presents the phenomenon of a
double one</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> That the Caribs maintained the common
etiquette of reserve between parents and children-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
makes it not improbable that the reserve extended
itself to their language, and thus produced the
same phenomenon that we find in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the same way other cases of wife-capture appear
simply in the light of savage lawlessness, which may
have been more common among quite primitive tribes
than it is in their nearest modern representatives; but
which, if it ever was widely prevalent, is most unlikely
to have been perpetuated in symbol, by a form of capture.
If then the form is easily explicable on other
grounds, such as have been suggested, we have a reason
the less for supposing in the past a state of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which would exclude from the relations between male
and female the happy influence of that mutual affection
which has been shown not to have been entirely absent
even among, perhaps, the rudest of our species, the
aborigines of Australia or the Veddahs of Ceylon, and
which is certainly disseminated more or less widely,
outside the human race, through a large part of the
animal creation.</p>

<p>It is probably impossible to resuscitate in imagination
a picture of primitive times. It is with the lower
societies of the world as with the lower animal organisms:
the more they are studied, the more wonderful
is the complexity of structure they unfold. Tribal
and subtribal divisions of communities, tribal and
subtribal divisions of territory, strong distinctions of
rank, stringent rules of etiquette, are found on all
sides to characterise populations in other circumstances
of life scarcely less rude than the brute creation around
them. The first beginnings of social evolution are
lost, nor can they be observed in any known races
that appear to have advanced the least distance from
the starting-point of progress. But, as there is no
reason to suppose that the external conditions of
primitive man were ever very different from those of
existing tribes; that those, for instance, of the shell-mound
builders or the cave-dwellers differed widely
from those of existing Ahts or Bushmen, so there is
nothing unreasonable in believing, that the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
human denizens of the globe were endowed with the
same rudiments of feelings that prevail among them,
and that these should, even in very early times, have
produced very similar social institutions. That Greeks
and Egyptians, Chinese and Hindus, had legends
ascribing marriage to the invention of a particular
legislator, thereby implying there was a time when
marriage was not, no more proves that there was ever
a time when some sort of marriage was unrecognised
than the many legends of the origin of fire prove that
mankind were ever destitute of the blessing of its
warmth. A minimum of reflection on the subject
would produce the legend, just as reflections on the
world’s origin have produced countless legends of its
creation, of a time when it too was nonexistent. And
it will be found, wherever any known savage tribe
really practises no wedding customs, that the fact of
the marriage is distinctly recognised, either by payment
in kind or labour by the bridegroom or by
some symbolical act notifying the union to all fellow-tribesmen.
The Veddahs, for instance, according to
Tennant, used no marriage rites; but another writer
mentions, that on the day of marriage the husband
received from his bride a cord twisted by herself, which
he had to wear round his waist till his death, as a
symbol of the lastingness of the union between them.
The Kherias of India, who have no word for marriage
in their language, give public recognition to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
by certain rites and festivities, closely analogous to
those in vogue in neighbouring tribes. The Coroadas
of Brazil have no marriage solemnity, but the suitor
presents the bride’s parents with fruit or game, as a
tacit engagement to support her by the chase. Such
a tacit expression of willingness and ability to take
good care of his wife is a common symbolical act
among savages, even the rudest; whilst the fact that
for the married pair henceforth there will be a union
of life and fortune is indicated by many a wedding
custom, of no doubtful meaning, as by the eating of
a cake together, or by the Dyak custom of making
the married couple sit together on two bars of iron,
‘to intimate the wish of the bystanders that blessings
as lasting and health as vigorous as that metal may
attend the pair.’</p>

<p>But symbolical acts like these—and they might
be multiplied indefinitely—presuppose an advanced
state of thought and feeling, behind which we cannot
get in the observation of any existing savage tribes;
and since they are common wherever the pretence of
capture is common, that pretence may well be symbolical
too; but symbolical, not of an earlier system
of marriage, but of a conventional regard for good
manners. Wherever the pretence of capture exists, it
exists amid conditions of life so far removed from
what might naturally be conceived as the most archaic,
that it is quite legitimate to attribute the decorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
reluctance of the bride and the resistance of her relations
at weddings to such feelings as have been proved
to prevail upon such occasions, and so to consider the
bride’s behaviour as something quite unconnected
with the lawless practice of wife-abduction, a practice
which undoubtedly prevails to a certain extent in the
savage world (chiefly in consequence of artificial social
arrangements), which may have prevailed to a still
greater extent when men lived in the caves of Périgord
or upon former continents, but which it is incredible
should ever have survived by transmission as a symbol,
as a custom worthy of religious preservation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE FAIRY-LORE OF SAVAGES.</i></span></h2>

<p>A comparison of some of the fancies of the rudest
known tribes of the earth concerning the nature of
the sun, the moon, and the stars, proves abundantly
not only that the demand for a reason for things is a
principle operative in every stage of human development,
but that the primitive explanation of things is
sought in the occurrences of daily experience and
given in terms and figures originally applied to terrestrial
objects. From a philosophy of nature of so
rude a type and so humble an origin spring many of
those marvellous traditions, which in after times rank
as the mythology, or perhaps serve as the religion, of
the people among whom they had birth.</p>

<p>To begin with some of the astro-mythological
ideas of the Australians. Mr. Stanbridge mentions
the astonishment with which, as he sat by his camp
fire, he listened for the first time to the remarks of
two Australian natives as they pointed to the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
constellations of Castor and Pollux, of the Pleiades
and Orion. These men belonged to a race who had
‘the reputation of being lowest in the scale of mankind,’
who were ‘cannibals of the lowest description,’
and ‘who had no name for numerals above two;’ yet
they could explain the wanderings of the moon, by
the story that, being once discovered trying to persuade
the wife of a certain star in Canis Major to
elope with him, he was beaten and put to flight by
the angry husband. As so frequently elsewhere,
most of the stars were bound by the ties of human
relationship, being wives, brothers, sisters, or mothers
to one another. The stars in the belt of Orion were
believed to be a group of young men dancing, whilst
the Pleiades were girls who played to them as they
danced. Two large stars in the fore legs of Centaurus
were two brave brothers who speared Tchingal
to death, and the east stars of Crux were the points
of the spears that pierced his body.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Few tribes of known savages appear to be without
conceptions of a similar nature. The Tasmanians,
according to Bonwick, were no exception to the
connection of theology with astronomy. To them
Capella was a kangaroo pursued by Castor and
Pollux, whose smoke as it was roasted might be seen
till the autumn. The Pleiades were maidens who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
courted the kangaroo hunters of Orion and dug up
roots for their suppers. Two other stars were two
black men who of old appeared suddenly on a hill
and threw fire down to earth for the use of its
inhabitants; whilst two other luminaries were two
women whom a sting-ray had killed as they dived for
cray-fish, but whom these same fire-bringers restored
to life, by placing stinging ants on their breasts; then
escorting them to heaven, after they had first killed
the sting-ray.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>Bushman star-lore is framed in exactly the same
way, the planets of distant solar systems sinking into
the insignificance of daily African surroundings.
What is the moon but a man who, having incurred
the wrath of the sun, is pierced by his knife till he is
nearly destroyed, and who, having implored mercy,
grows from the small piece left him, till he is again
large enough for the stabbing process to recommence?
What is the Milky Way but some wood ashes long
ago thrown up into the sky by a girl, that her people
might be able to see their way home at night?
Other stars are reduced to mortal origin, or identified
with certain lions, tortoises, or clouds, that have place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
in Bushman mythology; nor does it lie beyond their
limits of belief that the sun should once have been seen
sitting by the wayside as he travelled on earth, and
that the jackal’s back is black to this day because he
carried that burning substance on his back.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> This
sun they believe was once a mortal on earth who
radiated light from his body, but only for a short
space round his house; till some children were sent
to throw him as he slept into the sky, whence he has
ever since shone over the earth.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> These children
belonged to an earlier race of Bushmen; and it is an
odd coincidence that in Victoria as in South Africa
the belief about the sun is associated with the tradition
of a race that preceded both Bushmen and Australians
in their present homes. In the Australian creed,
the earth lay in darkness, till one of the former race
threw an emu’s egg into space, where it became the
sun. That former race was translated in various
forms to the heavens, where they made all the
celestial bodies, and where they continue to cause
all the good and evil that happens on earth. Such
traditions may point to a fact; for both Australians
and Bushmen may be degenerate from a better social
type than they now present; but the fact that, even
if degenerate, they should preserve such tales and
fictions, makes it not inconceivable that such tales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
should arise, as spontaneous products of the mind,
among tribes that seem neither to have lapsed from
a higher condition, nor ever to have emerged from
their primeval state of barbarism.</p>

<p>Of the Esquimaux, Egede observes that ‘their
notion about the stars is that some of them have
been men and others different sorts of animals or
fishes.’<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Here two stars are two persons at a singing
combat, or two rival women taking each other by the
hair; those other three are certain Greenlanders who,
when once out seal-catching, failed to find their way
home again and were taken to heaven. It is true
such fancies, taken primarily from Cranz, must be
received with the reservation that he makes, namely,
that they were only harboured by the weaker heads
of Greenland, and that the natives had art enough
to play off on the Europeans quite as marvellous
stories as any they received.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> But the possible reality
of such belief is vouched for by other testimony from
all parts of the globe, of which two instances, taken
from the Hervey Islanders and the Thlinkeet Indians,
will suffice to illustrate the general character. According
to the former, a twin boy and girl were badly
treated by their mother; so they left their home and
leapt into the sky, whither they were also followed by
their parents, and where all four may still be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
shining; ‘brother and dearly-loved sister, still linked
together, pursue their never-ceasing flight, resolved
never again to meet their justly-enraged parents.’<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
The Thlinkeet Indians ascribe to a being called Yehl
the liberation of the world from its pristine darkness;
for, amid the many conflicting stories told of him, it
is agreed that he it was who obtained light for men
at a time when ‘sun, moon, and stars were kept by a
rich chief in separate boxes which he allowed no one
to touch.’ Yehl, having become grandson to this
chief, cried one day so much for these boxes that his
grandfather let him have one. ‘He opened it, and
lo! there were stars in the sky.’ The grandparent
was next cheated out of the moon in the same way;
but to get the sunbox Yehl had to refuse food and
become really ill, and then its owner only parted with
it on condition that it should not be opened. The
prohibition, however, was unheeded. Yehl turned into
a raven, flew off with the box, and blessed mankind
with the light of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>From these samples of the fairy tales of savages,
it is clear that, in addition to the myths which arise
from forgotten etymologies, there are many others
which are not formed at all by this process of gradual
forgetfulness, but spring directly from the use of the
intellect and the imagination, in obedience to the impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to find a reason for everything. To observe
peculiarities in nature is the beginning of science; to
account for them in any way is science itself, true or
false. The science of savages is not limited to the
skies, but is directed to everything that calls for notice
on earth; nor in the stories invented by them to
answer the various problems of existence, are they a
whit behind the traditions of European folk-lore on
similar subjects, their explanations of natural peculiarities
disclosing quite as vivid imaginative powers
as the stories of the white race concerning birds or
beasts.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, as a parallel to the
German reason for the owl flying in solitude by night
(namely, that when set to watch the wren, imprisoned
in a mousehole, he fell asleep, and was so ashamed at
letting him thus escape that he has never since dared
show himself by day), the story of the rude Ahts,
made to account for the melancholy note of the loon
as it is heard flying about the wild lakes of Vancouver’s
Island; and as a good instance of the resemblance
in construction of plot often found in very
distant regions, let us place side by side with it a story
of the Basutos in the south of Africa:—</p>

<div class="lang1">

<p class="center"><i>THE AHT STORY.</i></p>

<p>Two fishermen went one day in
two canoes to catch halibut. But
while one of them caught many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the other caught none. So the
latter, angered by the taunts of his
more fortunate but physically
weaker companion, bethought himself
how he might take all his fish
from him by force, and cause him to
return home fishless and ashamed.
Suddenly, whilst his friend was
pulling up a fish, he knocked
him on the head with the wooden
club he used for killing halibut,
and, to prevent the tale ever being
told, cut out his companion’s
tongue, and took the fish home to
his own wife. When the tongueless
man arrived at the village,
and his friends came to enquire of
his sport, he could only answer by
a noise resembling the note of the
loon. ‘The great spirit, Quawteaht,
was so angry at all this, that
he changed the injured Indian into
a loon, and the other into a crow;
and the loon’s plaintive cry now
is the voice of the fisherman trying
to make himself understood.’<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<div class="lang2">

<p class="center"><i>THE BASUTO STORY.</i></p>

<p>Two brothers, having gone in
different directions to make their
fortunes, met again, after sundry
adventures, the elder enriched by
a pack of dogs, the younger by a
large number of cows. The
younger offered his brother as
many of these cows as he pleased,
with the exception of a certain
white one. This he would not
part with; so as they went home,
and the younger brother was
drinking from a pool, Macilo, the
elder, seized his brother’s head
and held it under the water till
he was dead. Then he buried the
body, and covered it with a stone,
and proceeded to drive back the
whole flock as his own. He had
not, however, gone far, before a
small bird perched itself on the
horn of the white cow and exclaimed:
‘Macilo has killed Maciloniane
for the sake of the white
cow he coveted.’ Twice did Macilo
kill the bird with a stone, but each
time it reappeared and uttered the
same words. So the third time
he killed it he burnt it, and threw
its ashes to the winds. Then
proudly he entered his village, and
when they all enquired for his
brother, he said that they had
taken different roads, and that he
was ignorant where he was. The
white cow was greatly admired,
but suddenly a small bird perched
itself on its horns and exclaimed:
‘Macilo has killed Maciloniane
for the sake of the white cow he
coveted.’ Thus, through a bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
into which the heart of the murdered
man had been transformed,
did the truth become known, and
everyone departed with horror from
the presence of the murderer.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>European folk-lore accounts for the redness of the
robin’s breast, either by the theory that he extracted
a thorn from the thorn-crown of Christ, or by the
theory that he daily bears a drop of water to quench
the flames of hell. For either reason he might be
justly called the friend of man; but for the bird’s friendliness
the Chippewya Indians give a more poetical
explanation than either of the above. There was once,
they say, a hunter so ambitious that his only son
should signalise himself by endurance, when he came
to the time of life to undergo the fast preparatory to
his choosing his guardian spirit, that after the lad had
fasted for eight days, his father still pressed him to
persevere. But next day, when the father entered the
hut, his son had paid the penalty of violated nature,
and in the form of a robin had just flown to the top
of the lodge. There, before he flew away to the woods,
he entreated his father not to mourn his transformation.
‘I shall be happier,’ he said, ‘in my present
state than I could have been as a man. I shall
always be the friend of men and keep near their
dwellings; I could not gratify your pride as a warrior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
but I will cheer you by my songs.... I am now
free from cares and pains, my food is furnished by
the fields and mountains, and my path is in the
bright air.’<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Not less poetical is the Hervey Islanders’ account
of the origin of some peculiarities among fishes, and
notably of the well-known conformation of the head
of the common sole. They relate how Ina, leaving
the house of her rich parents because she had been
beaten and scolded for suffering the arch-thief, Nyana,
to steal certain treasures left in her charge, resolved to
make her way to the sea beach, and from thence to
the Sacred Isle that lay across the sea at the place
where the sun set. Arrived at the shore, she first
asked the small fish, the <i>avini</i>, to bear her across the
sea; but the avini, unable to support her weight, soon
let her fall into the water, for which Ina in her anger
struck it repeatedly with her foot, thereby causing
those beautiful stripes on its sides which are called to
this day ‘Ina’s tattooing.’ Trying next the <i>paoro</i>,
and meeting with the same mischance, she caused it
in the same way to bear ever after those blue marks
which are now its glory; and it is said to be historically
true that tattooing on that island ‘was simply
an imitation of the stripes on the avini and the paoro.’
Then the <i>api</i>, a white fish, incurring the same displeasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
became at once and for ever of an intensely
black hue. The sole, indeed, carried Ina farther than
the others, but no farther than the breakers by the
reef; and Ina, now wild with rage, stamped with such
fury on its head that its underneath eye was removed
to the upper side, and thus it was condemned ever
afterwards to swim flatwise, unlike other fish, because
one side of its face had no eye. How Ina then caused
a protuberance on the forehead of all sharks, known
to this day as Ina’s bump, by cracking a cocoa-nut
she wished to drink out of on the forehead of a shark
that bore her, how the shark then left her, and how
she finally reached the Sacred Isle on the back of the
king of sharks, and became the wife of Timirau, the
king of all fish, may be read in further detail in Mr.
Gill’s interesting collection of Myths and Songs from
the South Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The necessity for a reason for everything, exemplified
in these traditions, exercises its influence on
mythology itself, reasons being invented for inexplicable
customs or beliefs just as they are for strange
phenomena in nature. The custom, for instance, of
hunting a wren to death once a year, which has been
observed in Ireland, the isle of Man, and the South
of France, has for its general explanation a belief that
the wren is a fairy who, after having decoyed many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
men to meet their deaths in the sea, took the form of
a wren to escape the plot laid for her by a certain
knight-errant. But the Irish have found quite another
reason for the custom, having invented the story, that
on the eve of the battle of the Boyne the Irish had
stolen up to King William’s sleeping camp and were
on the point of putting an end to the heretics, when a
wren hopped upon the drum of a Protestant drummer,
and by thus waking him caused their defeat; a defeat
which they avenge on every anniversary of the day by
the persecution of that unhappy bird.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>The story of the wren is well known; how, when
the birds were competing for the kingship by the test
of the greatest height attained in flying, the wren hid
in the eagle’s feathers, and, when the eagle had flown
far beyond the other birds, darted himself yet a little
above it. It is said that the first appearance of this
story is in a collection of beast-fables, composed by a
rabbi in the 13th century.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> But the resemblance
between the wren-story as it is told in Germany or
Ireland, and a story of a linnet as told by the Odjibwas
of North America, is so striking a testimony of the
way in which closely similar tales are framed independently,
that the two stories are worth comparing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<div class="lang1">

<p class="center"><i>THE ODJIBWA STORY.</i></p>

<p>‘The birds met together one
day to try which could fly the
highest. Some flew up very swift,
but soon got tired, and were
passed by others of stronger wing.
But the eagle went up beyond
them all, and was ready to claim
the victory, when the grey linnet,
a very small bird, flew from the
eagle’s back, where it had perched
unperceived, and being fresh and
unexhausted, succeeded in going
the highest. When the birds came
down and met in council to award
the prize, it was given to the eagle,
because that bird had not only
gone up nearer to the sun than
any of the larger birds, but it had
carried the linnet on its back.’</p>

<p>For this reason the eagle’s
feathers became the most honourable
marks of distinction a man
could bear.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="lang2">

<p class="center"><i>THE IRISH STORY.</i></p>

<p>‘The birds all met together
one day, and settled among themselves
that whichever of them
could fly highest was to be the
king of all. Well, just as they
were on the hinges of being off,
what does the little rogue of a
wren do, but hop up and perch
himself unbeknown on the eagle’s
tail. So they flew and flew ever so
high, till the eagle was miles above
all the rest, and could not fly
another stroke, he was so tired.
“Then,” says he, “I’m king of
the birds....” “You lie,” says
the wren, darting up a perch and
a half above the big fellow. Well,
the eagle was so mad to think how
he was done, that when the wren
was coming down, he gave him
a stroke of his wing, and from
that day to this the wren was
never able to fly further than a
hawthorn bush.’<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to assign limits either to the vitality
or to the range of a story. If the commerce
which has ever prevailed between the different tribes
of the world, as it prevails to this day, either by conquest
or by barter, has caused so wide a dispersion of
the races and products of the earth, the wonder would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
rather be if the products of men’s thoughts and fancies
had not prevailed so widely, had not taken so deep
root in man’s memory, seeing that they cost nothing
either to carry or to keep. For many stories therefore
of wide range, agreeing in such minute particulars
as to render difficult the theory of their independent
origin, the mystery of their resemblance is amply
solved by the theory of their gradual dispersion,
without their proving anything as to the common
origin of those who tell them. The story, for instance,
of Faithful John, the central idea of which is, that a
friend can only apprise some one of a danger he
will incur on his wedding night, by himself incurring
suspicion and being turned into stone, is told with
little variation in Bohemia, Greece, Italy, and Spain;
and the discovery of the leading thought in a story in
India makes it possible that it was there originated.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
In Polynesia, again, the story of stopping the motion
of the sun is widely spread; in New Zealand, Maui
makes ropes of flax, goes with his brothers to the
point where the sun rises, hides from it by day, and
when it rises next day succeeds in his purpose before
letting it go further. In Tahiti, Maui is a priest, or
chief of olden time, who builds a marae which must
be finished by the evening, and who therefore seizes
the sun by its rays and binds him to a tree till his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
work is finished. In Hawaii Maui stops the sun till
evening, because his wife has to finish a certain dress
by twilight. In Samoa, Maui appears as Itu, a man
who is anxious to build a house of great stones, but
is unable to do so because the sun goes too fast; he
therefore takes a boat and lays nets in the sun’s path,
but as these are broken through, he makes a noose,
catches the sun, and only lets it free when his house
is finished.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Obviously, these stories are all related,
but it is impossible to say whether they spread from
any one place to the others, or whether they are
remnants, retained in altered form, from the primitive
mythology of a common Polynesian home. It is,
however, worthy of notice that in Wallachian fairy
lore also a cow pushes back the sun to the hour of
mid-day, to enable a youth who had fallen asleep to
accomplish his task,<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and that the idea of catching
the sun is not unknown to the mythology of America.</p>

<p>There is, however, a large class of stories which
arise independently, and owe their remarkable family
likeness neither to a common descent nor to importation,
but to the natural promptings of the imagination.
Thus, the idea of a tree so high that it reaches the
heavens, and consequently of the heavens as thereby
attainable, naturally produces such a story as Jack
and the Beanstalk, a story which is said to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
all over the world, but the versions of which agree in
no other single point than in the admission to the sky
by dint of climbing.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> In the same way many of the
ideas common to the Indo-European nations, and so
often explained as originally derived from the fanciful
meteorology of the primitive Aryans, find startling
analogues outside the Aryan family, where there is
no reason to suppose them anything more than the
direct offspring of the dreamer or the story-teller.
If the constancy of Penelope to Ulysses, tormented
by her suitors, is simply that of the evening light,
assailed by the powers of darkness, till the return of
her husband the sun in the morning,<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> shall we apply
the same interpretation to the story of the wife of the
Red Swan, of the Odjibwas, who, when he returns
from the discovery of his magic arrows from the
abode of the departed spirits, finds that his two
brothers have been quarrelling for the possession of
his wife, but been quarrelling in vain?<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> If the legend
of Cadmus recovering Europa, after she has been
carried away by the white bull, the spotless cloud,
means that ‘the sun must journey westward until he
sees again the beautiful tints which greeted his eyes
in the morning,’<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> shall we say the same of a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
current in North America, to the effect that a man once
had a beautiful daughter whom he forbade to leave the
lodge lest she should be carried off by the king of the
buffaloes; and that as she sat, notwithstanding, outside
the house, combing her hair, ‘all of a sudden the
king of the buffaloes came dashing on, with his herd
of followers, and taking her between his horns, away
he cantered over plains, plunged into a river which
bounded his land, and carried her safely to his lodge
on the other side,’ whence she was finally recovered
by her father?<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Again, in Hindu mythology, Urvasi came down
from heaven and became the wife of the son of Budha,
only on condition that two pet rams should never
be taken from her bedside and that she should never
behold her lord undressed. The immortals, however,
wishing Urvasi back in heaven, contrived to steal the
rams; and as the king pursued the robbers with his
sword in the dark, the lightning revealed his person,
the compact was broken, and Urvasi disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
This same story is found in different forms among
many people of Aryan and Turanian descent, the
central idea being that of a man marrying someone
of aerial or aquatic origin, and living happily with
her till he breaks the condition on which her residence
with him depends. Thus there is the story of Raymond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of Toulouse, who chances in the hunt upon the
beautiful Melusina at a fountain and lives with her
happily till he discovers her fish-nature and she
vanishes; but exactly parallel stories come no less
from Borneo, the Celebes, or North America than from
Ireland or Germany; for which reason it seems sufficient
to receive them simply as they stand, as fairy
tales natural to every tribe of mankind that has a
fixed belief in supernatural beings, rather than to
explain these wonderful wives as the ‘bright fleecy
clouds of early morning, which vanish as the splendour
of the sun is unveiled.’<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Let us compare the story
as it is told in America and Bornoese tradition.</p>

<div class="lang1">

<p class="center"><i>THE BORNOESE STORY.</i></p>

<p>A certain Bornoese, when far
from home, once climbed a tree
to rest, and whilst there ‘was attracted
by the most ravishing
music, which ever and anon came
nearer and nearer, until it seemingly
approached the very roots of
the tree, when a pure well of
water burst out, at the bottom of
which were seven beautiful virgins.
Ravished at the sight, and determined
to make one of them his
son’s wife, he made a lasso of his
rattan, and drew her up.’ One
day, however, her husband hit her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in anger, and she was taken up to
the sky.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="lang2">

<p class="center"><i>THE AMERICAN STORY.</i></p>

<p>Wampee, a great hunter, once
came to a strange prairie, where
he heard faint sounds of music,
and looking up saw a speck in the
sky, which proved itself to be a
basket containing twelve most
beautiful maidens, who, on reaching
the earth, forthwith set themselves
to dance. He tried to catch
the youngest, but in vain; ultimately
he succeeded by assuming
the disguise of a mouse. He was
very attentive to his new wife,
who was really a daughter of one
of the stars, but she wished to
return home, so she made a wicker
basket secretly, and by help of a
charm she remembered, ascended
to her father.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It has been imagined that all the fairy tales of the
world may be reduced to certain fundamental story
roots; but these story roots we should look for not
in the clouds, but upon the earth, not in the various
aspects of nature, but in the daily occurrences and
surroundings of savage life. The uniformity which
appears in so many of the myths or fairy tales of the
world would thus simply arise from a uniformity of the
experiences of existence. The evidence concerning
savage astro-mythology is conclusive, that nothing is
conceived of the heavenly bodies that has not its
prototype on earth; that the skies do but mirror the
events or objects of earth, where the memorable incidents
of the chase or the battle are told of the stars:
nor is it strange if in a few years such tales should
have so gained in the telling, that it is often impossible
to separate the fact from the fiction, or to
distinguish a crude supposition from the creation of
a fanciful myth.</p>

<p>For although it is difficult to lay down the
boundaries between the language of metaphor and the
language of fact, inasmuch as what is faith to one man
is often but fancy to another, there is reason to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
that savages really do very often confuse celestial with
terrestrial phenomena, that, for instance, the Zulus,
when they speak of the stars as the children of the
sky and of the sun as their father, are expressing
rather a real belief than a poetical fancy, and that the
conception of the sun and moon as physically related
is an actual belief quite as much as a merely figurative
explanation. If this be true, a large part of mythology
must be regarded not as a poetical explanation
of things, suggested by the grammatical form of words
or by roots that lend similar names to the most diverse
conceptions, but as the direct effect of primitive
thought in its application to the phenomena of nature.
It is more likely that the early thoughts of men
should have framed their language than that the form
of their language should have preceded their form of
thought. And if it be shown (by those who hold that
the personification of impersonal things is consequent
on the grammatical structure of a language) that the
Kafirs and other tribes of South Africa, whose language
does not denote sex, are almost destitute of
myths and fables, whilst tribes who employ a sex-denoting
language have many,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> it is noticeable that
such personification has been shown to exist among
the natives of Australia, between the different dialects
of whose language it is said to have been one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
points of resemblance, that they recognised no distinctions
of gender.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>A story of the Ottawa Indians (by internal
evidence posterior in date to their acquaintance with
guns and ships) may be taken as a sample of savage
traditions, which prove that the convertibility of mankind
with sun, moon, or stars, is as natural a belief to
a savage, as that his next-door neighbour may turn
at pleasure into a wolf or a snake. Six young men
finding themselves on a hill-top in close proximity to
the sun, resolved to travel to it. Two of them finally
reached a beautiful plain, lighted by the moon, which,
as they advanced, appeared as an aged woman with
a white face, who spoke to them and promised to conduct
them to her brother, then absent on his daily
course through the sky. This woman ‘they knew
from her first appearance’ to be the moon. When
she introduced them to her brother, ‘the sun motioned
them with his hand to follow him,’ and they accompanied
him with some difficulty till they were restored
safe and sound to the earth.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> So Sir G. Grey, collecting
native legends concerning a cave in Australia,
found that the only point of agreement was
‘that originally <i>the moon who was a man</i> had lived
there.’<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>But, except on the assumption that savages are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
idiots, it is impossible that such legends should not only
obtain currency, but enjoy the vitality of traditions,
unless they conform to certain canons of belief, unless
they contain nothing inherently incredible. A fairy
tale pleases a child, not because it is known to be impossible,
but because it carries the mind further afield
than actual experience does into the realms of the
possible; and a tale understood to be impossible
would be as insipid to a savage as it would be to a
child. Schoolcraft, in reference to Indian popular
tales, speaks of the ‘belief of the narrators and listeners
in every wild and improbable thing told;’ and says,
‘Nothing is too capacious for Indian belief.’<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> If, as
their stories abundantly show, they feel no difficulty in
conceiving the instantaneous transformation of men not
merely into something living, but into stones or stumps,
the fact ceases to be strange, that in Indian faith
‘many of the planets are transformed adventurers.’<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
What, then, more natural than that all over the world
the deeds of great tribesmen should be transferred to
the skies, and, under the action of uniform laws of
fancy, should in time become so overgrown with
fiction as to pass into the domain of the purest mythology,
till at last they appear as mere figurative
expressions of the daily life of nature, of the struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
between the day and the night, of the dispersion of the
clouds by the sun?</p>

<p>The condition of things which makes such conceptions
of the heavens the natural outcome of primitive
speculation may perhaps, to a certain extent, be recovered
by observation of the laws conditioning the
actually existent thoughts of the savage world.</p>

<p>The first entrance into Wonderland lies through
Dreamland. Schoolcraft’s testimony that ‘a dream
or a fact is alike potent in the Indian mind’ accords
with much other evidence to the effect that, with
savages, the sensations of the sleeping or waking life
are equally real or but vaguely distinguished. A
native of Zululand will leave his work and travel to
his home, perhaps a hundred miles away, to test the
truth of a dream,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> and so great is the importance the
Zulus attach to such monitions, that ‘he who dreams
is the great man of the village;’ whilst the gift to them
of ‘<i>sight by night in dreams</i>’ is ascribed to their first
ancestor, the great Unkulunkulu.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> But how far surpassing
even the normal experiences of sleep must be
the dreams of men in the hunting or nomad state,
the law of whose lives is either a want or an excess of
food! What richer fund for story-material can be
imagined than the dreams of a savage, or what more
likely to introduce him to the mysteries of romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
than recollections of those sudden transformations or
those weird images, which have haunted the repose of
his slumbering hours? And into what strange lands
of beauty and plenty, into what secrets of the skies,
would not the flights of his sleep give him an insight!
In all fairy tales and all mythology a remarkable conformity
to the deranged ideas of sleep does thus occur;
and especially do the stories of the lower races, as for
instance those of Schoolcraft’s ‘Algic Researches,’
read far more like the recollections of bad dreams
than like the worn ideas of a once pure religion, or
of a poetical interpretation of nature. The most
beautiful of the Indian legends, that of the origin of
Indian corn, was in native tradition actually referred
to a dream, and to a dream purposely resorted to, to
gain a clearer insight into the mysteries of nature.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
And as dreams do but deal with the incidents of the
waking life, exaggerating them and contorting them,
but never passing beyond them, may not the somewhat
uniform incidents of savage life, whether of
hunting, fishing, fighting, or travelling, offer some
explanation of that general similarity, which is so
conspicuous an element in the comparative mythology
or the fairy-lore of the world?</p>

<p>Then the fact that the dead reappear in dreams at
that season of the night in which also the stars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
seen, would tend to confirm the idea of some community
of nature between the dead and the stars, such
community as is indeed not unfrequently found, as
where the Aurora Borealis or the Milky Way are
identified with the souls of the departed. So, too, a
Californian tribe is mentioned as having believed that
chiefs and medicine-men became heavenly bodies after
their death,<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and even Tasmanians could point to the
stars they would go to at death.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>But there is another reason which would still
further create a mental confusion between the deeds
of a mortal on earth and the motions of some luminary
in heaven, and that is the language of adulation, which,
from ascribing the possession of the sky to a chief, in
order to gratify him, becomes imperceptibly the language
of belief. It is common for the Zulus to say
of a chief, ‘That man is the owner of heaven and
everything is his,’ and a native once expressed his
gratitude to a missionary by pointing to the heaven
and saying, ‘Sir, the sun is yours.’ ‘It does not suffice
them to honour a great man unless they place the
heaven on his shoulders; they do not believe what
they say, they merely wish to ascribe all greatness to
him.’ If when a chief goes to war the sky becomes
overcast, they say, ‘The heaven of the chief feels that
the chief is suffering.’ Nor was any chief known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
deprecate the use of such language; he ‘expected to
have it said always that the heaven was his.’<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Obviously, however, there is no fast line between
the language of flattery and the language of fact.
From the Tahitians, who would speak of their kings’
houses as the clouds of heaven, or the Kafirs of Ethiopia,
who called their kings lords of the sun and moon,
it is easy to trace the progress of thought which actually
led the latter people to pray to their kings for
rain, fine weather, or the cessation of storms.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The
Zulus, like many other savages, think of the sky as at
no great distance from the earth, and thus as the roof of
their king’s palace in the same way that the earth is its
floor. ‘Utshaka claimed to be king of heaven as well as
earth, and ordered the rain-doctors to be killed, because
in assuming power to control the weather they
were interfering with his royal prerogative.’<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> But if
such confusion between royalty and divinity can exist
in the savage mind whilst the king is on earth, how
natural is it that a man, associated for so long in his
lifetime with power over the elements, should, after his
removal from earth and from sight, become still more
mixed up with elemental forces, or perhaps even localised
in some point of space! The word Zulu actually
means the Heavens, and in Zululand King of the Zulus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
means king of the heavens,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> so that when the king is
drawn in his waggon to the centre of the kraal, it is
not surprising that, among the other acclamations,
such as ‘Lion, King of the World,’ with which his
creeping subjects salute him, they should actually
salute him as Zulu, Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> It can only be from
the use of such language that among the Zulus ‘rain,
storm, sunshine, earthquakes, and all else which we
ascribe to natural causes are brought about or retarded
by <i>various people</i> to whom this power is ascribed.
Every rain that comes is spoken of as belonging to
somebody, and in a drought they say that the owners
of rain are at variance among themselves.’<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>That in aftertime, from these modes of thinking
and speaking, the attributes of a Zulu or Tahitian
chief might become those of a heaven-supporter, such
as Atlas, or of a cloud-gatherer, such as Zeus, or that,
according as his body was consigned to the earth or
the sea, such a chief might become the earth-shaker
or the ocean-ruler, is not only what might be expected
<i>à priori</i>, but what is to some extent justified by facts.
In South Africa the word which the missionaries have
adopted for both Hottentots and Kafirs as the name
for the Deity, from its being the nearest approach to
the Christian conception, is believed to be derived
from two words signifying Wounded Knee, a term
applied generations back to a Hottentot sorcerer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
great fame and skill, who happened to have sustained
some injury to his knees. ‘Having been held in high
repute for extraordinary powers during life, he (Utixo)
continued to be invoked even after death as one who
could still relieve and protect; and hence in process
of time he became nearest to their first conceptions
of God.’<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> And the legend of Mannan Mac
Lear, mythical first inhabitant and first legislator of
the Isle of Man, discloses a germ of similar origin
underlying the myth of a culture-hero, as his story
preserved in the following lines will show:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘This merchant Manxman of the solemn smile,</div>
<div class="verse">First legislator of our rock-throned isle,</div>
<div class="verse">Dwelt in a fort (withdrawn from vulgar sight),</div>
<div class="verse">Cloud-capped Baroole, upon thy lofty height.</div>
<div class="verse">From New Year tide round to the Ides of Yule,</div>
<div class="verse">Nature submitted to his wizard rule.</div>
<div class="verse">Her secret force he could with charms compel</div>
<div class="verse">To brew a storm or raging tempests quell;</div>
<div class="verse">Make one man seem like twenty in a fray,</div>
<div class="verse">And drive the stranger (<i>i.e.</i> Scotch invaders) over seas away.’<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In other words, he was a great sorcerer and a
great warrior, whose deeds lived after him in story,
and whose name lent itself as a nucleus, like that
of Charlemagne or of Alfred, for every adventure
that was strange, for every imagination that was wonderful.</p>

<p>There seems, indeed, no reason to seek for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
higher genesis than this for any of the culture-heroes
of any mythology, notwithstanding that they have
with so much unanimity been forced into identification
with the sun. Zeus himself means but the same
thing as Zulu, namely, the Sky or Heaven, so that it
is only natural that nothing that could be told of the
sky ‘was not in some form or other ascribed to Zeus,’<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
just as we see that modern Zulus ascribe to their
chiefs all atmospheric phenomena, and actually confer
on them the appellation, Zulu. There is indeed
nothing in which Zeus differs essentially from Manabozho
of North American mythology, from Krishna
of the Hindus, from Maui of the Polynesians, from
Quawteaht of the rude Ahts, or from Kutka of the
still ruder Kamschadals. The stories told of one
may be more refined than those told of another,
but in no case are these divinities more than names,
which serve as convenient centres for the grouping
of memorable feats or fictions. Such names serve
also, when once men have begun to reflect on the arts
or customs of their lives, as sufficient explanations of
their origin; and just as we find the institution of
marriage attributed in China, or Greece, or India to
some mythical hero, so we find the discovery of fire
and light, or the invention of remarkable arts, duly
ascribed to some hypothetical originator. In Polynesian
mythology, Maui, in Thlinkeet Indian mythology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Yehl, played the part of Prometheus in procuring
fire for the use of men. From seeing a spider make
its web, Manabozho invented the art of making
fishing nets; and Kutka (who, like Manabozho, is
also in some sense the maker of all things) taught the
Kamschadals how to build huts, how to catch birds,
and beasts, and fish.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The supreme deity of Finnish
mythology not only brought fire for men from heaven
but was the inventor of music; yet like the other gods
he was but a magician, able to destroy the world at
pleasure, to hold the sun captive in a box, to conquer
all monsters and heal all diseases.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>American mythology abounds in culture-heroes,
mythical personages who taught men useful arts and
laws, and left, in the reverence attached to their
memory, a quasi-religious system for their posterity.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
These too have been resolved into observation of the
phenomena of the sun or the dawn. Manabozho or
Michabo, the ancestor of the Algonquins, whose name
literally means the Great Hare, and conferred peculiar
respect on the clan who bore it as their totem, means
in reality (according to this theory) the Great Light,
the Spirit of Dawn, or under another aspect the
North-west Wind; the confusion between the hare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the dawn being supposed to have arisen from a root
<i>wab</i>, which gave two words, one meaning <i>white</i> and
the other <i>hare</i>, so that what was originally told of the
White Light came to be told of a Hare, and what
was at first but a personification of natural phenomena
became a tissue of inconsistent absurdities.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Ingenious,
however, as such a solution undoubtedly is, it
is easier to believe that the stories of the Great Hare
have grown round a man, called, in complete accordance
with American custom, after the hare, and
once a famous sorcerer or warrior like Mannan Mac
Lear; for in all the more recent traditions of him,
there is much more of the magician or shaman than
of the wind or the dawn. He turns at will into a
wolf or an oak stump, he converses with all creation,
he outwits serpents by his cunning, he has a lodge
from which he utters oracles; as brother of the
winds, by reason of his swiftness, there is no incongruity
in the idea that since his death he is the
director of storms, and resides in the region of his
brother, the North Wind. It is curious that he is
swallowed up by the king of the fish, in this resembling
in Aryan mythology Pradyumna, the son of
Vishnu, who after being swallowed by a fish is ultimately
restored to life,<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> or in Polynesian mythology
Maui, who is rescued by the sky from the embrace of
the jelly fish. Maui, like Tell, Sigurd, Hercules, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
others, has recently been discovered to be the sun,
the fish which swallows him signifying really the
earth; for does not the earth swallow the sun every
night, and is not the sun only freed by the eastern
sky in the morning?<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Doubtless, on such a reading
of his life, Manabozho has as just a claim as Mani to
a place in the solar system; but then—who that has
ever lived and died but has the same?</p>

<p>Samé, the great name of Brazilian legend, came
across the ocean from the rising sun; he had power
over the elements and tempests; the trees of the
forests would recede to make room for him, the animals
used to crouch before him; lakes and rivers became
solid for him; and he taught the use of agriculture
and magic. Like him, Bochica, the great lawgiver of
the Muyscas and son of the sun, he who invented for
them their calendar and regulated their festivals, had
a white beard, a detail in which all the American
culture-heroes agree.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> It is not, however, on this
particular feature, so much as on their <i>whiteness</i> in
general that stress has been laid to identify them with
the great White Light of Dawn. Of the Mexican Quetzalcoatl,
Dr. Brinton says, ‘Like all the dawn heroes
he, too, was represented of white complexion, clothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
in long white robes.’ The white is the emphatic thing
about them. So the name Viracocha of the Peruvians,
translated by Oviedo, ‘the foam of the sea,’ is, we are
to believe, a metaphor: ‘the dawn rises above the
horizon as the snowy foam on the surface of the lake.’<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
But Peruvian tradition was confused as to whether
Viracocha was the highest god and creator of the
world, or only the first Inca; and such confusion between
humanity and divinity, which is everywhere the
normal result of the deification of the dead, is at least
a more natural account of the origin of his worship
than a fancied resemblance between the sea-foam
and the dawn.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Heitsi Eibip, whom the Namaqua
Hottentots call their Great Father, and on whose
graves they throw stones for luck, so far resembles a
solar hero that he is believed to have come like Samé
from the East; yet, though much that is wonderful
already attaches to his memory, he has not yet
thrown off his human personality, but is known to
have been merely a sorcerer of great fame;<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> so that
in his deification we have almost living evidence of
the process here assumed to have operated widely in
the formation of the world’s mythology.</p>

<p>To the influence of the language of adulation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the formation of mythology, may also be added that
of the language of affection or of ridicule. Nicknames,
taken at hazard from the animal world, or from any
object of earth, air, or water, would be obvious sources
of improbable stories, tending to the completest confusion
between the doings of a man and the attributes
of the thing after which he was named. Nicknames
of affection would produce the same result; and if,
as is likely, other people besides the Finns call their
daughters Moon, Sunshine, or Water-glimmer, it is
easy to see how, for instance, the departure of Sunshine
as a bride might come afterwards to be explained
as a myth of the dawn or of twilight, and in
the same way anything else that happened to her.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>An elemental explanation has been applied with
such uniform effect, first to Aryan and then to Polynesian
and American mythology, that in the resort
to a more natural, albeit less poetical hypothesis,
there may be danger of carrying opposing theories
too far. There are, however, certain obvious limits;
nor, if we doubt whether man in a primitive state
really had the poetical views of nature so generally
claimed for him, need we deny to him all poetical
origination in the construction of his mythology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Take, for instance, this typical Aryan passage, ‘By
the early Aryan mind the howling wind was conceived
as a great dog or wolf. As the fearful beast
was heard speeding by the windows or over the house-top,
the inmates trembled, for none knew but his
own soul might forthwith be required of him. Hence
to this day, among ignorant people, the howling of
a dog is supposed to portend a death in the family.’<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
When we find that a dog’s howling portends the
death of its master among the Nubians,<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and is regarded
as a dreaded omen by the Kamschadals,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> as
well as by the Fijians,<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and that the Esquimaux
lay a dog’s head by the grave of a child to show it
the way to the land of souls, we may safely reject
the Aryan pedigree of the superstition, nor go any
farther for its explanation than the nature of the
sound itself. But though Aryan mythology may be
taken to have grown, like any other, round human
personalities, and though popular superstitions are in
many instances the primary products of the laws of
psychology, ranking rather among the sources than
the <i>débris</i> of mythology, there is proof from the fairy-lore
of savages that some of them have so far advanced
in thought as to be not incapable of personifying abstract
ideas. Dr. Rink alludes to the tendency of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Esquimaux to give figurative explanations of things,
to personify, for instance, human qualities, just as
they are personified in the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress.’<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> The
Chippewya Indians personified sleep as Weeng, a giant
insect that was once seen on a tree in a wood, where
it made a murmuring sound with its wings; and it
was generally conceived to cause sleep by sending a
number of little fairies to beat drowsy foreheads with
their tiny clubs.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> And the Odjibwas, with a fancy
which has been so poetically preserved by Longfellow,
identified Winter with an old hoary-headed man
called Peboan, Spring with a young man of quick
step and rosy face called Segwun.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The testimony, therefore, afforded by the observation
of modern savage races as to the growth of
mythology discloses several ways in which, as it is
being formed now, we may infer that it was formed
thousands of years ago. The evidence of Steller
that the Kamschadals explained everything to themselves
according to the liveliness of their fancy,
letting nothing escape their examination,<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> accords with
evidence concerning other races to the effect that some
intellectual curiosity enters as a constituent into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
lowest human intelligence, giving birth to explanations
which are as absurd to us as they are natural to
their original framers. A ready capacity for invention
is no rare trait of the savage character. Sir G.
Grey found that the capability of Australian natives
to invent marvels and wonders was proportioned to
the quantity of food he offered them, and that rather
than confess ignorance of a thing they would <i>invent</i>
a tradition;<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> whilst in the fondness of the Koranna
Hottentots, as they sit round their evening fires,
of relating fictitious adventures, lies a source of
legendary lore which is not likely to be limited to
South Africa, and is probably aided elsewhere as it
is there by the knowledge, common to so many
savage tribes, of the preparation of intoxicating
drinks.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> If to these sources of mythology be added
the help supplied by dreams to the elaboration of
fiction; the misconceptions effected in traditions by
the language of flattery, of affection, or of ridicule;
and, lastly, the tendency, probably consequent on
such confusion, to personify things or even abstract
ideas; the wonder will no longer be that the mythology
of the different races of the world displays so
much uniformity, but that uniformity within limited
ranges should ever have been taken as a proof of a

<span class="smaller"><i>COMPARATIVE FOLK-LORE.</i></span></h2>

<p>Folk-lore is often explained as the remains of
ancient mythology, but the explanation, though
perhaps true of some traditional lore still surviving in
legends and fairy tales, seems of doubtful application
to those popular superstitions yet so prevalent among
us, of which our kitchens, our cottages, and our
nurseries are the chief depositories. Beliefs, fancies,
and customs, however trivial in themselves, and
locally absurd, gain an interest from the area they
cover and the races they connect; suggesting past
unions between nations now remote, in the same
way as the smallest weeds are capable of telling,
by their geographical dispersion, of lands that once
stretched where seas now roll. To take some instances.
The English tradition that a swallow’s
nest is lucky, and its life protected by imaginary
penalties, is one that in isolation we should naturally
and rightly disregard. But when we find that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
belief belongs to Germany, and that the supposed
penalties are the same in Yorkshire as they are in
Swabia, our wonder is aroused; and when we further
learn that in China, too, the swallow’s nest is lucky
and its life inviolate, we become aware of a possible
history and antiquity attaching to the superstition,
which offer an inviting field for speculation and study.
The belief, that the first appearance of mice in a
house betokens death, becomes of interest when we
find it in Russia as well as in Devonshire. Mothers
there are both in Germany and in England who fear
their children may grow up to be thieves if their nails
are cut before their first year is over. Such superstitions,
as we call them, had, without doubt, once a
reason; in some cases still to be traced, in others
effaced by the wear and tear of time. By the
application to them of the comparative method not
only may we hope to explain and connect ideas
otherwise inexplicable, but also to come to conclusions
not uninteresting from an archæological point
of view. For if it can be shown that they are the
remains of ancient barbarism rather than of ancient
mythology, their testimony may be added to that,
long since given by the more material relics and
witnesses of early times, concerning the general history
of civilisation.</p>

<p>For the existence of similar traditions as of similar
fairy-tales in widely remote districts there are three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
possible hypotheses. These are, migration, community
of origin, or similarity of development. Either they
have spread from one place to another, or they are the
legacies of times when the people possessing them were
actually united, or they have sprung up independently
in different localities, in virtue of the natural laws of
mental growth. It may be difficult of any given
belief to say to which of these three classes it belongs;
but there are many beliefs, so alike in general
features, yet so divergent in detail, as best to accord
with the theory of a common descent or a common
development. Some, for instance, may be so common
to the different nations of one stock, as to be traceable
to periods anterior to their dispersion; whilst
others, yet more widely spread than these, suggest
relationships between races of men more fundamental
and remote than can be detected in language, and
point to an affinity that is older and stronger than
mere affinity of blood, an affinity, that is, in the conceptions
and fancies of primitive thought. For
where actual relationship is not proved by language,
analogies in tradition are better accounted for by
supposing similar grooves of mental development
than by any other theory. Philology may prove
a relationship between, let us say, the Nixens of
Germany and the Nisses of Scandinavia: but
there is no relationship beyond similarity of conception
between the Nereids of antiquity and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
mermaids of the North, or between the Brownies of
Scotland and the Lares of Latium. Children, of
whatever race or country they may be, dislike the
dark, nor is it thought necessary to account for this
common trait by any theory of connection or descent.
So it is with nations. They are or were, in the face
of nature, but as children in the dark, and the nearly
similar phenomena of sun and storm, breeze and calm,
have sufficed to create for them, in their several homes,
many of those fears and fancies we find common to
them all.</p>

<p>No one who has not turned special attention
to the subject, can form any conception of the mass
of purely pagan ideas, which, varnished over by
Christianity, but barely hidden by it, grow in rank
profusion in our very midst and exercise a living
hold, which it is impossible either to realise or to
fathom, on the popular mind. Like old Roman or
British remains, buried under subsequent accumulations
of earth and stones, or superficially concealed
by an overgrowth of herbage, uninjured during all
the length of time they have lain unobserved, there
they lie just beneath the surface of nineteenth-century
life, as indelible records of our mental history
and origin. Only in the higher social strata can they
be deemed extinct; but if it can no longer be said,
as it was in the seventeenth century, that most
houses of the West-end of London have the horse-shoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on the threshold,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> yet it may still be said of
many a farm or cottage in the country. The
astronomer Tycho Brahe, if he met an old woman or
hare on leaving home, would take the hint to turn
back: but it seems to be only the working population
of England, Scotland, or Germany who still do
the same. Statistics show that the receipts of
omnibus and railway companies in France are less on
Friday than on any other day; and many a German
that lay dead on the carnage fields of the late war
was found to have carried his word-charm as his safest
shield against sword or bullet. Most English villages
still have their wise men or women, whose powers
range, like those of the shamans in savage tribes, from
ruling the planets to curing rheumatics or detecting
thieves; and witchcraft still has its believers, occasionally
its victims, as of yore.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>We who have been brought up to look upon the
classification of things into animal, vegetable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
mineral, as primary, or indeed intuitive, are apt to
forget that savages never classify, and that animate
and inanimate to them are both alike. Sir John
Lubbock has collected conclusive evidence that so
inconceivable a confusion of thought exists.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The
Tahitians, who sowed some iron nails that young
ones might grow from them; the Esquimaux, who
thought a musical-box the child of a small hand-organ;
the Bushmen, who mistook a large waggon
for the mother of some smaller ones, show the
tendency of savages to identify motion with life, and
to attribute feelings and relations such as actuate or
connect themselves to everything that moves of itself
or is capable of being moved. A native sent by one
missionary to another with some loaves, and a letter
stating the number, having eaten two of them and
been detected through the letter, took the precaution
the next time to put the letter under a stone that it
might not <i>see</i> the theft committed.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Now there are
numerous superstitions, which there is reason to
think are relics of this savage state of thought,
when all that existed existed under the same conditions
as man himself, capable of the same feelings,
and subject to the same wants and sorrows. Take,
for example, bees. Bees are credited with a perfect
comprehension of all that men do and utter, and, as
members themselves of the family they belong to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
they must be treated in every way as human in their
emotions. On the day of the Purification in France
it is customary in some parts for women to read the
Gospel of the day to the bees.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> French children are
taught that the inmates of the hive will come out to
sting them for any bad language uttered within their
hearing; and in South Russia it is believed ‘that if
any robbery be committed where a number of hives
are kept, the whole stock will gradually diminish, and
in a short time die; for bees, they say, will not suffer
thieving.’<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Many persons have probably at some time
of their lives, on seeing a crape-covered hive, learnt on
inquiry that the bees were in mourning for some
member of their owner’s family. In Suffolk, when a
death occurs in a house, the inmates immediately tell
the bees, ask them formally to the funeral, and fix crape
on their hives; otherwise it is believed they would
die or desert. And the same custom, for the same
reason, prevails, with local modifications, not only in
nearly every English county, but very widely over
the continent. In Normandy and Brittany may be
seen, as in England, the crape-set hives; in Yorkshire
some of the funeral bread, in Lincolnshire some
cake and sugar, may be seen at the hive door; and
a Devonshire nurse on her way to a funeral has been
known to send back a child to perform the duty she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
herself had forgotten, of telling the bees. The usual
explanation of these customs and ideas is that they
originated long ago with the death or flight of some
bees, consequent on the neglect they incurred when
the hand that once tended them could do so no
longer. Yet a wider survey of analogous facts leads
to the explanation above suggested; for, not to dwell
on the fact that in some places in England they are
informed of weddings as well as of funerals, and
their hives are decorated with favours as well as with
crape, the practice of giving information of deaths
extends in some parts not only to other animals as
well, but, in addition, to inanimate things. In
Lithuania, deaths are announced, not only to the
bees, but to horses and cattle, by the rattling of a
bunch of keys, and the same custom is reported from
Dartford in Kent. In the North Riding, not long
since, a farmer gravely attributed the loss of a cow to
his not having told it of his wife’s death. In Cornwall,
the indoor plants are often put into mourning as
well as the hives; and at Rauen, in North Germany,
not only are the bees informed of their master’s death,
but the trees also, by means of shaking them. Near
Speier, not only must the bees be moved, but the
wine and vinegar must be shaken, if it is wished that
they shall not turn bad. Near Würtemburg, the
vinegar must be shaken, the bird-cage hung differently,
the cattle tied up differently, and the beehive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
transposed. Near Ausbach the flower-pots must also
be moved, and the wine-casks knocked three times;
while at Gernsheim, not only must the wine in the
cellar be shaken, to prevent it turning sour, but the
corn in the loft must be moved if the sown corn is to
sprout.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> But all these customs, being too much alike
to be unrelated, and too widely spread to have sprung
up without some reason, by some mere caprice or
coincidence, it is difficult to suggest any other reason
for them than that they go back to a time when not
only bees and cattle, but trees and flowers, vinegar
and wine, were, like human beings, considered liable
to take offence, and capable also of being pacified
by kind treatment, since, according as their several
temperaments predisposed them, they were able, by
deserting, dying, turning sour, or other untoward
conduct, to resent neglect or disrespect on the part
of their owners. Such beliefs belong to the lowest
state of mental development, to a time when the most
obvious marks of natural differentiation were as yet
insufficient to produce corresponding distinctions in
the minds of their beholders.</p>

<p>Other popular traditions strengthen this interpretation.
In Normandy and Brittany it is thought that
bees will not suffer themselves to be bought or sold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in other words, that they would take offence if made
the subjects of sale and barter.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The same belief prevails
in Cheshire, Suffolk, Hampshire, Cornwall, and
Devonshire, like the old Russian rule that sacred
images might not be spoken of as ‘bought’ but only
as ‘exchanged for money.’<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The value of bees is
measured, not by money, but by corn, hay, or some
other exchangeable commodity; in Sussex, if any
money is given for bees, it must be gold. Connected
with this idea of the quasi-humanity of bees is the
world-wide fear of slighting dangerous animals by
calling them by their customary names. Mahometan
women dare not call a snake a snake lest they should
be bitten by one; Swedish women avert the wrath of
bears by speaking of them as old men. Livonian fishermen,
when at sea, fear to endanger their nets by calling
any animal by its common name. At Mecklenburg,
in the twelve days after Christmas, the fox goes by the
appellation of the ‘Long Tail;’ even the timid mouse
by that of the ‘Floor-runner.’ The Esthonians at all
times call the fox ‘Gray Coat,’ the bear ‘Broad-foot,’
and should they take the liberty of too often mentioning
the hare, their flax crops, they fear, would be in
peril. In Sweden people dare not mention to anyone
in the course of the day the number of fish they have
caught, if they would catch any more; a feeling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
which is probably related the North-Country prejudice
against counting one’s fish before the day’s sport is over.</p>

<p>Witchcraft, although it represents a very low stage
of religious conception, yet in its primary idea of a
sympathy or identity existing between an original and
its image, manifests some degree of intellectual advancement.
For the idea of vicarious or representative
influence, that if you wish to injure a man you
can do so by an injury to a bit of his clothing or a
lock of his hair, is, so far as it goes, a spiritual idea,
presupposing notions about the interdependence of
nature, and as far as possible removed from what we
understand by mere materialism. Materialism indeed
is one of the latest growths of the human mind, whilst
spiritualism is one of its earliest. For to a savage,
everything that exists lives and feels like himself, and
the unseen spirits that surround and affect him are as
the motes in a sunbeam for variety and number. The
native Indian speaks of the earth as ‘the big plate
where all the spirits eat.’<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Yet the fetichistic
mode of thought is undoubtedly a low, and to us an
absurd one. Burnings in effigy may probably be
traced to it, and the stories so common in the annals
of witchcraft of waxen images stuck with pins or
burned, in order to injure the person they represented,
undoubtedly belong to it. In America Kane found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
an Indian tribe who believed that the hair of an
enemy confined with a frog in a hole would cause
the owner of the hair to suffer the torments of the
frog.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> In the Fiji Islands the health of a person can
be made to fail with the decay of a cocoa-nut buried
under a temple.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The Finns are said to this day to
shoot in the water at images of their absent enemies.
But our own country has its analogies. In Suffolk, in
the last century, if an animal was thought to be bewitched,
it was burned over a large fire, under the
idea that as it consumed away the author of its bewitchment
would consume away too. In Anglesey it
is still believed that the name of a person inscribed on
a pipkin, containing a live frog stuck full of pins, will
injuriously affect the bearer of the name.</p>

<p>There are a numerous set of popular traditions
which clearly relate to the same state of thought.
There is a feeling so wide that it may be called
European, that cut hair should always be burned,
never thrown away: the reason given in France, in
the Netherlands, in Denmark, and near Saalfeld in
Germany, being, that its discovery by a witch would
subject its owner to sorcery; that generally given in
England and also in Swabia being, that if a bird took
any of it for its nest the bearer would suffer from
headache or lose the rest of his hair. A similar idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
prevails about teeth: all over England children are
taught to throw extracted teeth into the fire, lest a
dog by swallowing them should induce the toothache.
So with the nail that has scratched you, or the knife
that has cut you,—keep the nail or knife free from
rust, and the wound will not fester. But all such ideas
are explained by those actually existent in savage
parts, by the custom, for instance, of the Fijians of
hiding their cut hair in the thatch of the house, that it
may not be used against them in witchcraft, or by the
practice of Zulu sorcerers to destroy their victims by
burying some of his hair, his nails, or his dress in a
secret place, that the decay of the one may ensure that
of the other. And a similar philosophy lies at the
root of most popular charms for certain complaints.
The remedies for warts, for instance, are all vicarious.
Both at home and abroad the most usual method is
to rub a black snail on the wart, and then to hang it
on a hedge, trusting to the sympathetic decay of the
wart and snail. But a piece of stolen raw meat, a
stalk of wheat or a hair with as many knots in them
as there are warts on the hand, or two apple halves
tied together, will, if applied to the part and then
buried, cause effectual relief. The essential thing is to
ensure the decay of the representative object. In
Somersetshire a good ague cure is to shut up a large
black spider in a box and leave it to perish, that spider
and ague may disappear together. In many places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
it is thought that the whooping-cough may be transferred
to a hairy caterpillar tied in a bag round the
neck: as the insect dies the cough will go. And in
Devonshire some of the patient’s hair is given to a
dog between two slices of buttered bread, that the dog
may take the hair and the cough together; whilst in
Sunderland the head is shaved and the hair (risking
we must suppose a headache) left on a bush for the
birds to carry off, that the cough itself may pass to
them. May it not be said that such customs and
fancies betray a mental constitution radically different
from our present one, taking us back and ever reminding
us of the savagery of our lineage as surely as do
flint-flakes or bone-needles, and teaching us that only
by the slowest degrees can emancipation be achieved
from the superstitions, or, as some think, from the
poetry, of ignorance?</p>

<p>Again, trees, stones, waters, stars, serpents, or
animals, are all to this day worshipped far and wide
by uncivilised races, and the marks of a similar object-worship
by our own race still survive in many a
popular tradition. A law of Canute earnestly forbade
the heathenship of reverencing ‘the sun or moon,
fire or flood, waterwhylls, or stones, or trees of the
wood of any sort;’ yet, if such things are no longer
worshipped, it may be certainly said that some of them
are still reverenced. To take, for instance, tree-worship.
Both in Guiana and Africa the natives have so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
superstitious a reverence for the silk cotton tree that
they fear to cut it down lest death should ensue.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> In
New Zealand mythology, Rata was rebuked and put
to shame by the spirits of the forest for cutting down
a tall tree-divinity for making his canoe.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> The trees
which occupy the most prominent place in European
folk-lore are the elder, the thorn, and the rowan or
mountain ash. In Denmark a twig of elder placed
silently in the ground is a popular cure for toothache
or ague, whilst no furniture, least of all a cradle, may
be made of its wood; for the tree is protected by the
Elder-mother, without whose consent not a leaf may
be touched, and who would strangle the baby as it lay
asleep. So also about Chemnitz, elder boughs fixed
before stalls keep witchcraft from the cattle; and
wreaths of it hung up in houses on Good Friday, after
sunset, are believed to confer immunity from the
ravages of caterpillars. In Suffolk, it is the safest tree
to stand under in a thunderstorm, and misfortune will
ensue if ever it is burned. The legend that the cross
was made of its wood is evidently an aftergrowth, an
attempt, of which we have so many examples, to give a
Christian colour to a heathen practice; for the elder
was the tree under which, in pre-Christian times, the
old Prussian Earth-god was fabled to dwell. Like
the elder, the whitethorn was once an object of worship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for it too is held to be scatheless in storms; and
how else can we account for the fact that in Switzerland,
as in the Eastern counties of England, to bring
its flowers into a house is thought to bring death,
than by supposing it was once a tree too sacred to
be touched, and likely to avenge in some way the
profanation that was done to it? Too deeply rooted
in popular veneration for its sacred character to disappear,
the Church, in course of time, wound its own
legend round it, and by the fiction that its wood had
composed the Crown of Thorns, deprived the worship
of its heathen sting. But if round the elder and the
thorn feelings of reverence once gathered and still
linger, yet more is it true of the rowan. In England,
Germany, and Sweden its leaves are still the most
potent instrument against the darker powers: Highlanders
still insert crosses of it with red thread in the
lining of their clothes, and Cornish peasants still carry
some in their pocket and wind it round the horns of
their cattle in order to keep off evil eyes. In Lancashire
sprigs of it are for the same reason hung up at
bedheads, and the churn staff is generally made of its
wood. It used to stand in nearly every churchyard
in Wales, and crosses of it were regularly distributed
on Christian festivals as sure preservatives against
evil spirits. But this is another attempt to Christianise
what was heathen, for the ancient Danes always
used some of it for their ships, to secure them against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the storms which Rân, the great Ocean God’s wife,
with her net for capsized mariners, was ever ready and
desirous to raise. The rowan in heathen mythology
was called Thor’s Helper, because it bent to his grasp
in his passage over a flooded river on his way to the
land of the Frost Giants; and it has been thought that
the later sanctity of the tree may be due to the place
it occupied in mythological fancy. Yet it seems more
reasonable to trace the myth to a yet older superstition
than to trace the superstition to the myth. For
from the exceeding beauty of their berries the rowan
and the elder and the thorn would naturally impress
the savage mind with the feelings of actual divinity,
and would consequently lend themselves to the earliest
imaginings about the universe of things. It is more
likely that they progressed from a divinity on earth
to their position in mythology than from their position
in mythology to a divinity on earth, for the mind is
capable of employing things for worship long before
it is capable of employing them for fable. Worship
is the product of fear, and fable of fancy; and before
men can indulge in fancy they must to some extent
have cast off fear.</p>

<p>Certain traditions relating to birds and beasts are
only explicable on the supposition that they were once
objects of divination or worship. The old Germans,
we know from Tacitus, used white horses, as the
Romans used chickens, for purposes of augury, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
divined future events from different intonations of
neighings. Hence it probably is that the discovery
of a horse-shoe is so universally thought lucky, some
of the feelings that once attached to the animal still
surviving round the iron of its hoof. For horses, like
dogs or birds, were invariably accredited with a
greater insight into futurity than man himself; and
the many superstitions connected with the flight or
voice of birds resolve themselves into the fancy,
not inconceivable among men surrounded on all sides
by unintelligible tongues, that birds were the bearers
of messages and warnings to men, which skill and
observation might hope to interpret. Why is the
robin’s life and nest sacred, and why does an injury
to either bring about bloody milk, lightning, or rain?
It has been suggested that the robin, on account of
its colour, was once sacred to Thor, the god of lightning;
but it is possible that its red breast singled it
out for worship from among birds, just as its red berries
the rowan from among trees, long before its worshippers
had arrived at any ideas of abstract divinities.
All over the world there is a regard for things red.
Captain Cook noticed a predilection for red feathers
throughout all the islands of the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> In the
Highlands women tie some red thread round the
cows’ tails before turning them out to grass in spring,
and tie red silk round their own fingers to keep off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the witches: and just as in Esthonia, mothers put
some red thread in their babies’ cradles, so in China
they tie some round their children’s wrists, and teach
them to regard red as the best known safeguard
against evil spirits.</p>

<p>One, indeed, of the chief lessons of Comparative
Folk-Lore is a caution against the theory which
deduces popular traditions from Aryan or other mythology.
The fact has been already alluded to, that
in parts of China the same feelings prevail about the
swallow as in England or Germany. But there are
yet other analogies between the East and the West.
A crowing hen is an object of universal dislike in
England and Brittany; and few families in China
will keep a crowing hen.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The owl’s voice is ominous
of death or other calamity in England and Germany,
as it was in Greece (except at Athens); but in the
Celestial Empire also it presages death, and is regarded
as the bird which calls for the soul. And the
crow also is in China a bird of ill omen. Is it not
therefore likely that all popular fancies about birds
and animals have begun in the same way, among the
same or different races of the globe, and were subsequently
adopted but never originated by mythology?
May it not be that certain birds or animals became
prominent in mythology because they had already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
prominent in superstition, rather than that they became
prominent in superstition because they previously
had been prominent in mythology? For instance,
instead of tracing a dog’s howling as a death omen to
an Aryan belief that the dog guided the soul from its
earthly tenement to its abode in heaven, may we not
suppose that the myth arose from an already existing
omen, and that the latter arose, as omens still do, from
a coincidence which suggested a connection, subsequently
sustained by superficial observation? The
St. Swithin fallacy, which arose within historical
memory and still holds its ground in an age of scientific
observation, well illustrates how one striking coincidence
may grow into a belief, which no amount of later
evidence can weaken or destroy. Just so, if it happened
that a dog howled shortly before some calamity
occurred to our Aryan forefathers, thousands and
thousands of years ago, long before they had attained
to any thoughts of soul or heaven, we can well
imagine that the dog, thus thought to betoken death,
should, when they came to frame the myth, be conceived
as the guide which was waiting for the soul to
take it to heaven, and that the belief thus perpetuated
by the myth might survive to the latest ages.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence in the practices to
this very day, or till lately, prevalent in England and
Europe, that the worship of the sun or of fire fills
a large part in primitive religion. The passing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
children through the fire is not only a Semitic custom,
but extends wherever the human mind has attained
to the idea of purification and sacrifice. Some North
American tribes used to burn to the sun a man-offering
in the spring, to the moon a woman-offering in
the autumn, expressing thereby their sense of the
blessings of light and a desire for their continuance.
And traces of such fire-worship and of its accompanying
human sacrifices lasted in Europe into the very
heart of this century, and in many places still survive.
The similarity that exists between them, both in their
seasons and mode of observance, illustrates the marvellous
sameness of ideas which may so often be found
among people in widely remote districts of the globe.</p>

<p>The three great festivals of the Druids took place
on Mayday Eve, on Midsummer Eve, and on All
Hallow-e’en. On those days went up from cairns,
foothills, and Belenian heights fires and sacrifices to
the sun-god Beal: and from such fires the lord of the
neighbourhood would take the entrails of the sacrificed
animal, and, walking barefoot over the ashes,
carry them to the Druid who presided over the ceremonies.
These fires have descended to us as the
famous Beltane fires, lit still, or till lately, in Ireland,
Scotland, Northern England, and Cornwall, on the eve
of the summer solstice and at the equinoxes, usually
on hill tops, with rejoicing and merriment and leaping
through the flames on the part of all ages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
sexes of the population.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> It is possible that this
leaping through the flames is a relic of the time
when men fell victims to them, a modification of
the more barbarous custom. In the Highlands, where
at the Beltane feast an oatmeal cake is toasted and
portions of it drawn for blindfold by the company as
they sit in a trench round a grass table, whosoever
is the drawer of that portion which has been purposely
toasted black is devoted to Baal to be sacrificed, and
must leap perforce three times through the flames.
In the same country it is, or was, customary on Yeule
or Christmas Eve to burn in a cartload of lighted
peat the stump of an old tree, which went by the
name of Callac Nollic, or Christmas Old Wife. And
in several Continental traditions we find the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of a sacrifice still adhering to Midsummer Eve, or St.
John the Baptist’s Vigil. On that day, in Livonia,
one or two old boats were burned to the songs and
dances of young and old; whilst at Reichenbach, in
the Voightland, a May-pole, planted on the green,
was, after similar festivities, thrown into the water.
On the same day many watermen still refrain from
committing themselves to the Elbe, the Unstrut, or
the Elster, from the belief that upon that day those
rivers require a sacrifice; and the Saale is avoided
for the same reason on Walpurgis, or Mayday Eve, as
well. From the latter cases we may infer that, where
rivers flowed near, a sacrifice by water was as usual
as one by fire, which possibly explains the custom so
common in many places in connection with these
Beltane fires of rolling something lighted down a hill,
and, if possible, into a river. At Conz, on the Moselle,
a burning wheel was rolled down the hill into the river,
and Scotch children at the Beltane feast used to roll
their bannocks three times down a hill before consuming
them round a good fire of heath and brushwood.
So in Swabia, wheels of lighted straw were rolled down
the Frauenberg, and on Scheiblen-Sonntag the young
people still go by night to a hill, and after dancing
and singing round a fire, swing wooden wheels by
means of a stick round and round till they are
thoroughly alight, and then fling them down the hill.
In North Germany, where the fires take place at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Easter instead of at Midsummer, lighted tar-barrels
are rolled down the Osterberge. The Church, to
sanctify these fires, made the day of John the
Baptist coincident with Midsummer-day, and taught
that the heathen customs were symbolical of Christian
doctrine. The fires themselves signified the Baptist,
that burning and shining light who was to precede
the true light; whilst the rolling wheels, as they represented
the gradual descent of the sun in heaven
after it had reached the highest point, so they illustrated
the diminution of the fame of John, who was
at first thought to be the real Messiah, till on his own
testimony he said, ‘He must increase, but I must
decrease.’ It has even been attempted in recent
times to show that the Midsummer fires, in spite of
all their heathen surroundings, were really of Christian
origin, and in some way connected with John the
Baptist. The two chief objections to this theory are,
the survival of heathen names for the fires, as for
instance, among others, the name Himmelsfeuer, and
not the usual Johannisfeuer, in one of the districts of
Upper Swabia, and also the close analogy, both in
the idea and mode of purification, which exists
between the Midsummer fire for men and the Needfires
for cattle.</p>

<p>Needfires were fires through which cattle were
driven if any disease broke out amongst them. Such
a fire was lit in Mull in 1767, and was not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
method lately employed in Lower Saxony, but is said
to be still actually prevalent in Caithness. It would
thus appear that after the sacrifice to fire had been
modified into the custom of passing through or over
it, the newer mode of cure gradually found its explanation
in the idea, that fire was a healing or purifying
agent on account of its power to drive away those evil
spirits, which in savage estimation cause or constitute
natural disease. The essential thing was that all fires
in the neighbourhood should be first extinguished and
new ones relit by means of friction for the cattle to go
through. The virtue lay in the new virgin fire uncontaminated
by previous use for any purpose whatsoever;
and the Forlorn Fires, which are said to be still lighted
in Scotland when any <i>man</i> thinks himself the victim
of witchcraft,<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> agree closely in ceremonial with the
Needfires for cattle. A notice having been given to
all the householders within the two nearest streams
to extinguish all lights and fires on a given morning,
the sufferer and his friends on the day cause the
emission of new fire by a spinning-wheel or other
means of friction, and having spread it from some
tow to a candle, thence to a torch, and from the
torch to a peatload, send it by messengers to the
expectant houses. But exactly similar purificatory
effects were attributed to the Midsummer fires. As
far as their light reached, crops enjoyed immunity from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
sorcery for a year, and the ashes collected from them
were a constant insurance against calamities of all
sorts. Leaping through them was held to avert
malignant spirits for a year, and in many places not
only did men leap, but cattle were driven, through
the flames. Both America and Africa supply
curious analogues to the Needfires of Scotland. In
the former the Mayas at a festivity in honour of their
gods of agriculture danced about the ashes of a burnt
pile of wood, and passed barefooted over the coals
with or without injury, believing that thus they would
avert misfortune and appease the anger of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
And among the Hottentots Kolbe attests the custom
of driving sheep through a fire, and though the
reason told to him for it was, the warding off the
attacks of wild dogs by the smell of smoke, the other
ceremonies usual on the occasion suggest the interpretation
applicable to the Scotch custom.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Purification
by passing between two fires was also a custom of
the Tartars.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Hence there is reason to think that the Midsummer
fires were simply annual and public Needfires,
resembling the yearly harvest feasts of the
Creeks of North America, among whom, as among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the ancients who annually imported fresh fire from
Delos to Lemnos, there was an idea of a new and
purified life commencing with a new and pure flame,
after all fires, debased by their subservience to human
needs, had been first extinguished. The Minnetarees
at their feast of the new corn made a new fire by
drilling the end of a stick into a piece of hard wood;<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
and the Sioux at their sacred feasts were wont to
remove all fire from the lodge and rekindle a fresh
fire before cooking the food, in order to have nothing
unclean at the feast.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> In India the Nagas, when
they clear a fresh piece of jungle, first put out their
old fires, and produce a new fire by friction, that of
ordinary domestic use not being considered pure
enough for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The same idea has been found among the Indian
tribes of South America. There it was the duty of
the high-priests ‘to guard the Eternal Fire in the
Rotunda; and, in the solemn, annual festival of the
Busque, when all the fires of the nation were extinguished,
the high-priest alone was commissioned, in
the temple, to reproduce the celestial spark and give
new fire to the community.’<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> So that from this most
remarkable identity of conception between our forefathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and the native tribes of America, it is
evident there is nothing exclusively Indo-Germanic in
the holiness ascribed to virgin-fire, and that there is
no need to ascribe to Phœnician influence customs
which occur where such influence is at most uncertain.
The wheel ignited by friction of its axle was, it has
been suggested, an emblem of the sun, and the old
Aryan belief, that when the sun was hidden by clouds
its light was extinguished and needed renewing,
which could only take place by some god working a
‘pramantha’ in its cold wheel till it glowed again,
has been referred to as the possible root of the custom.
But such an origin being of difficult application outside
the geographical limits of Aryanism, it is obviously
better to refer the myth to the custom than the custom
to the myth, and to a custom moreover which is as
wide as the world.</p>

<p>It may here be noticed in connection with the
sacrificial customs which were once a part of the
heathen worship, that the idea of a sacrifice to
appease an angry spirit that has caused a disease is
still far from extinct. The burial of a live animal is
still believed in Wärend and North Sweden to
prevent the cattle-plague, and an instance of such a
sacrifice to the earth spirits is said to have occurred
in Jönköping so recently as 1843. In Moray not
long ago, whenever a herd of cattle was seized with
the murrain, one of them was buried alive, just as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the North-west Highlands and in Cornwall a black
cock is buried alive on the spot where a person is
first attacked by epilepsy; or as, in Algeria, one is
drowned in a sacred well for a similar purpose. A
case is even cited in this century of an Englishman
who burned a live calf to counteract the attacks of
evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Near Speier in Germany, if many hens
or pigs or ducks died in quick succession, one of
their kind was thrown into the fire, and the Esthonians,
if a fire broke out, were wont to throw in a black
living fowl to appease the flames.</p>

<p>English country boys, when on the sight of a new
moon they turn the money in their pockets to ensure
a constant supply there, have no idea of the reason
that once underlay the practice. But a wide comparison
of customs supplies us with a key; for we find
everywhere a prevalent mental association between
the increase or wane of the moon and the increase or
wane of things on earth. Maladies, it is thought, will
wane more readily if the medicine be taken in the
moon’s wane, and wood cut at that time will burn
better, just as, on the other hand, crops are more
likely to be plentiful if sown whilst the moon is
young, and marriages more likely to be happy. In
some English counties pigs must be killed at the
same season, lest the pork should waste in boiling.
In Germany it is the best time for the father of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
family to die, for in the latter half of the month
his death would portend the decrease of his whole
family; it is also the best time for counting money
which it is desired may increase. An invalid in face
of a waning moon should pray that his pains may
diminish with it. Hence, too, the French idea that
hair cut in the moon’s wane will never grow again, or
the similar one in Devonshire and Iceland, that the
rest will fall off; and hence probably the popular
English belief that the weather of the new moon foreshadows
the weather for the month. But are all
these fancies relics of an old moon-worship, of the
existence of which we have other evidence, or simply
expressions of that feeling, once so prevalent, that
there existed an intimate sympathy between man
and nature, and that everything which affected the
former was in some way or another typified by the
latter? Analogy seems to favour the latter hypothesis.
For instance, all along the East coast of
England it is thought that most deaths occur at the
fall of the tide, a sympathy being imagined between
the ebbing of the water and the ebbing of life; and
it is curious that Aristotle and Pliny entertained a
similar idea, the former with respect to all animals,
the latter only about man; and though Pliny’s
observation of the fact was instigated by the statement
of his predecessor, it is likely that the latter
was led to the inquiry by the notoriety of a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
belief. The Cornish idea that deaths are delayed till
the ebb-tide, or the Icelandic one that more blood
flows from sheep killed while the sea is running out,
or that chimneys smoke more if built when the sea is
running in, may be cited as similar instances. The
inhabitants of Esthonia, if a wolf runs away with a
lamb, think, by a kind of sympathy, to cause the
wolf to drop it by themselves dropping something out
of their pockets. And in parts of England to this
day, the bloodstone is a remedy for a bleeding nose,
and nettle-tea for a nettle-rash; just as turmeric was
once accounted a cure for the jaundice on account of
its yellow colour, and the lungs of a fox were held
good for asthma on account of that animal’s respiratory
powers.</p>

<p>Water-worship, whether as river, lake, or spring,
seems as widely spread as that of trees or other
natural objects, and the numerous traditions connected
with it form yet another link between our
civilised present and our barbarous past. ‘There is
scarcely,’ says a writer on Lancashire Folk-Lore, ‘a
stream of any magnitude in either Lancashire or
Yorkshire, which does not possess a presiding spirit in
some part of its course.’ A water-spirit that haunts
some stepping-stones near Clitheroe is still believed
once in every seven years to require a human life;
nor is it long since a farmer in Anglesea had to drain
a well belonging to him, on account of the damage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
done by persons resorting thither, under the belief
that if they cursed the disease they suffered from and
dropped pins about the well, they would shortly be
cured. There is still a pin-well in Northumberland,
and another in Westmoreland, wherein country girls
in passing throw an offering of pins to the resident
spirits. So in Ireland, votive rags may be seen on
trees and hedges that surround sacred wells, whither
people travel great distances in order to crawl an
uneven number of times in the sun’s direction round
the water, hoping thereby to propitiate the fairies and
to avert sorceries.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> St. Gowen’s well on the coast of
Pembroke was lately or is still frequented for the
cure of paralysis and other maladies, and there are
few counties in England where the dedication of curative
wells to Christian saints does not betray the
attempt to hallow and hide a heathen practice under
a Christian name. In Northampton alone we find
St. Lawrence’s at Peterborough, St. John’s at
Boughton, St. Rumbald’s at Brackley, St. Loy’s at
Weedon-Loys, St. Dennis’ at Naseby, St. Mary’s at
Hardwick, and St. Thomas’ at Northampton. So in
Normandy, people still resort from all parts of the
province, on the eve of the first of June, to the fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of St. Clotilde, near Andelys, and there are other
French wells of no inferior celebrity. As English
peasants propitiate bad water-spirits by presents of
pins, so do the Bretons by slices of bread and butter;
and the Livonians, before starting on a voyage, calm
the sea-mother by a libation of brandy.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> But water,
in addition to its dangerous and curative properties,
is supposed to contain prophetic ones as well. The
Castalian fountain in Greece was prophetic; and as
the Laconians, by cakes thrown into a pool sacred
to Juno, used to augur good or bad to themselves
according as their cakes sank or floated, so do our
Cornish countrymen by dropping pins or pebbles
into wells read futurity in the signs of the bubbles.</p>

<p>The belief in unseen spirits, which underlies many
of the foregoing superstitions, as it is one of the
earliest beliefs of the human mind, so it is one of the
most persistent. The worship of water, fire, and other
natural objects probably arose from a dread of spirits
thought to be resident within them, whom it was as
well to cajole by gifts and prayers. Earth and air,
like fire and water, were peopled respectively with
invisible demons, which survive in still current traditions
of the Gabriel Hounds, the Seven Whistlers,
fairies, elves, and all their tribe. Our countrymen in
Cornwall, if the breeze fail while they are winnowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
whistle to the Spriggian, or air-spirits, to bring it
back; and the Esthonians on the Gulf of Finland do,
or did, precisely the same. In Northamptonshire, till
lately, women used to sweep the hearth before they
went to bed, and leave vessels of water for the ablutions
of the fairies or spirits of the earth, just as in
Siberia food is placed daily in the cellar for the
benefit of the Domavoi or house-spirits. In Scotland
green patches may still be seen on field or moor left
uncultivated as ‘the gudeman’s croft,’ by which it has
been hoped to buy the goodwill of the otherwise evil-disposed
Devil or earth-spirit; and it is doubtless from
a similar fear of showing neglect or disrespect that
Esthonian peasants dislike parting with any earth
from their fields, and in drinking beer or eating bread
recognise the existence and wants of the earth-spirit
by letting some drops of the one and some crumbs of
the other find their way to the floor.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing instances of actual Folk-Lore, many
of them now mere meaningless survivals, seem only
intelligible on the ground that they have descended
to us either from the earliest inhabitants of Western
Europe, or from times when our Aryan progenitors
were perhaps not unlike modern Fuejians. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
existence has been proved, not only in England but
throughout Europe, of phases of thought and modes
of worship closely similar to those still found among
actual savages. There is no nation that we know in
the present or read of in the past so cultivated as not
to retain many spots from the dark ages of its infancy
and ignorance; but these, absurd as they may seem,
hold the rank and claim the interest of prehistoric
antiquities. The fact that there still survive among
civilised people ideas and practices, corresponding in
structure to those found in the various stages of the
lower races, is of the same force to prove that we once
went through those several stages, as the survival of
traits in the growth of the individual, similar to those
actually found in lower animals, point to our gradual
ascent from a lower scale of being. The belief in,
and dread of, evil spirits; the endeavour to affect
them by acting on their fetishes or substitutes; the
worship of natural objects, as trees, animals, water or
even stones; the mistaking of mere sequence in time
for causal connection and the consequent importance
attached to such occurrences as have been observed
to precede remarkable phenomena,—these and many
other characteristics of modern savages find abundant
representation in modern civilisation, and it is more
likely they are there as survivals than as importations.</p>

<p>But it may be urged that no necessary antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
can be asserted of traditions simply on account of the
wide area they range over, and instances may be cited
of Christian superstitions no less widely extended
than many above mentioned. The belief, for instance,
that about midnight on Christmas Eve, cattle rise on
their knees to salute the Nativity, is found with slight
modifications in England, Brittany, the Netherlands,
and Denmark. In Cornwall a strong prejudice exists
against burying on the north side of a church, and
precisely the same feeling is found in Esthonia, for
the reason there given that at the end of the world
all churches will fall on that side. So, too, the custom
of opening all doors and windows at a death, to
give free outlet to the departing soul, prevails no less
in the south of Spain than in England or in parts of
Germany.</p>

<p>To this objection there are two answers: first, that
the capacity of superstitions to spread widely and
rapidly is by no means denied; secondly, that many
Christian traditions are really heathen, though their
origin and meaning may now be lost. For the policy
of the Church towards paganism, though at times one
of radical opposition, was generally one better calculated
for success. It learned to prefer gradual triumphs
to speedy conquests, aware that the former were more
likely to last, and was pleased to satisfy its conscience
and hide its impotence under connivance and compromise.
It assimilated beliefs which it could not destroy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and glossed over what it could not erase, substituting
simply its saints and angels for the gods and spirits
of older cults. On Monte Casino, near Rome, there
existed down to the sixth century a temple sacred to
Apollo, till St. Benedict came and, like another Josiah,
broke the idols and overthrew the altar and burned
the grove, but set up a temple to St. Martin in its
stead. And this case is typical of the way in which
obstinate heathen rites were diverted and customs
consecrated. Some illustrations may be added to
those already incidentally alluded to, since they serve
to explain how so many relics of heathenism have resisted
centuries of Christian teaching. The Scandinavian
water-spirit, Nikur, inhabitant of lakes and
rivers and raiser of storms, whose favour could only
be won by sacrifices, became in the middle ages St.
Nicholas, the patron of sailors and sole refuge in danger;
and near St. Nicholas’ church at Liverpool there
stood a statue of the Christian saint, to whom sailors
used to present a peace-offering when they went to
sea, and a wave-offering when they returned. So it
was with sacred trees and flowers and waters. Their
sanctity was transferred, not destroyed. St. Boniface,
with the wood of the oak he so miraculously felled,
raised an oratory to St. Peter, to whom were thenceforth
paid the honours of Thor. Nobody ventured
the more to touch the famous oak at Kenmare when
blown down by a storm, because it had been handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
over to the protection of St. Columba, nor did a fragment
of St. Colman’s oak held in the mouth the less
avert death by hanging because it had been sanctified
by the name of a saint. The Breton princes, before
they entered the church at Vretou, offered prayers
under a yew outside, which was said to have sprung
from St. Martin’s staff and to have been so replete
with holiness that the very birds of the air left its
berries untouched. The great goddess Freja could
only be banished from men’s thoughts by transferring
what had been sacred to her to the Virgin Mary; and
the names of such common plants as Lady’s Grass,
Lady’s Smock, Lady’s Slipper, Lady’s Mantle, and
others, attest to this day the wrong that was done to
the Northern goddess. Bits of seaweed called Lady’s
Trees still decorate many a Cornish chimney-piece,
and protect the house from fire and other evils. The
Ladybird was once Freja’s bird; and Orion’s belt,
which in Sweden is still called Freja’s spindle, in
Zealand now belongs to her successor Mary. In the
same way Christmas has supplanted the old Yule
festival, and the Yule log still testifies to the rites of
fire-worship once connected with the season. So we
now keep Easter at the time when our pagan forefathers
used to sacrifice to the goddess Eostre, and
hot cross-buns are perhaps the descendants of cakes
once eaten in her honour, on which the mark of
Christianity has taken the place of some heathen sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Such then is the evidence which Comparative
Folk-Lore affords in confirmation of the teaching of
history, that the people from whom we inherit our
popular traditions were once as miserable and savage
as those we now place in the lowest scale of the
human family. The evidence that the nations now
highest in culture were once in the position of those
now the lowest is ever increasing, and the study of
Folk-Lore corroborates the conclusions long since
arrived at by archæological science. For, just as
stone monuments, flint knives, lake-piles, or shell-mounds
point to a time when Europeans resembled
races where such things are still part of actual life,
so do the traces in our social organism of fetishism,
totemism, and other low forms of thought, connect
our past with people where such forms of thought are
still predominant. The analogies with barbarism
which still flourish in civilised communities seem only
explicable on the theory of a slow and more or less
uniform metamorphosis to higher types and modes
of life, whilst they enforce the belief that before long
it will appear a law of development, as firmly established
on the inconceivability of the contrary, that
civilisation should emerge from barbarism, as that
butterflies should first be caterpillars, or that ignorance
should precede knowledge. In this way superstition
itself turns to the service of science, confirming
its teaching, that the history of humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
has been a rise, not a fall, not a degradation from
completeness to imperfection, but a constantly accelerating
progress from savagery to culture; that, in
short, the iron age of the world belongs to the past,
its golden one to the future.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_442" id="Footnote_442"></a><a href="#FNanchor_442"><span class="label">[442]</span></a> There are several derivations for Beltane or Bealteine: 1. From
Baal or Belus, the Phœnician god, the worship being supposed to be of
Phœnician origin; 2. from Baldur, one of the gods of Valhalla who represented
the Sun; 3. from lá = day, teine = fire, and Beal = the name of
some god, but not Belus; 4. from Paleteine, Pales’ fire, the worship
being identified with that of the Roman goddess Pales, who presided
over cattle and pastures, and to whom, on April 21, prayers and offerings
were made. At the Palilia shepherds purified their flocks by sulphur
and fires of olive and pine wood, and presented the goddess with cakes
of millet and milk, whilst the people leaped thrice through straw fires
kindled in a row. Yet we should probably be right if we connected
the Palilia and the Beltanes, not as directly borrowed one from the
other, but as co-descendants from one and the same origin.</p>

<p>Mr. Forbes-Leslie speaks of Beltane fires as still to be seen in 1865.
The Beltane feast proper was on May-day, but the word was also applied
to fires kindled in honour of Bel on other days, as on Midsummer Eve,
All Hallow-e’en, and Yeule, now Christmas. (<i>Early Races of Scotland</i>,
i. 120-1.)</p>
